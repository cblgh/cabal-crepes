ah, is it you, dantès?
a great misfortune, m. morrel
and the cargo?
what happened to him?
what happened to the worthy captain?
he died.
fell into the sea?
no, sir, he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony.
bear a hand there, to take in sail!
and how did this misfortune occur?
why, you see, edmond
stand by there to lower the topsails and jib; brail up the spanker!
let go—and clue up!
now, if you will come on board, m. morrel
well, m. morrel
yes—yes: poor captain leclere! he was a brave and an honest man.
but
yes
as to taking command of the vessel
dantès
in a moment, sir
and i’m with you.
let go!
half-mast the colors, and square the yards!
you see
and so, in fact, he is
except your signature and your partner’s, m. morrel.
and why should he not have this?
your pardon, m. morrel
then did you see him, edmond?
who?
the marshal.
yes.
and how is the emperor?
very well, as far as i could judge from the sight of him.
you saw the emperor, then?
he entered the marshal’s apartment while i was there.
and you spoke to him?
why, it was he who spoke to me, sir
and what did he say to you?
_pardieu!_ and that is true!
how could that bring me into trouble, sir?
yes, most satisfactory, my dear danglars.
well, so much the better
dantès has done his
to me?—no—was there one?
of what packet are you speaking, danglars?
why, that which dantès left at porto-ferrajo.
how do you know he had a packet to leave at porto-ferrajo?
he did not speak to me of it
then, m. morrel, i beg of you
well, my dear dantès, are you now free?
yes, sir.
you have not been long detained.
then you have nothing more to do here?
no—everything is all right now.
then you can come and dine with me?
right, dantès, quite right. i always knew you were a good son.
and
well, i believe, my dear edmond, though i have not seen him lately.
yes, he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room.
ah, ha
she is not my mistress
sometimes one and the same thing
not with us, sir
well, well, my dear edmond
no, sir; i have all my pay to take—nearly three months’ wages.
you are a careful fellow, edmond.
say i have a poor father, sir.
then i have your leave, sir?
yes, if you have nothing more to say to me.
nothing.
captain leclere did not, before he died, give you a letter for me?
to get married?
yes, first, and then to go to paris.
cannot sail without her captain.
without her captain!
ah, m. morrel
shall i row you ashore?
then i have leave?
go, i tell you.
may i have the use of your skiff?
certainly.
then, for the present, m. morrel, farewell, and a thousand thanks!
i hope soon to see you again, my dear edmond. good luck to you.
father—dear father!
what ails you, my dearest father? are you ill?
yes, yes, my boy, so we will—so we will
god forgive me
yes, my dear boy
it is very fortunate.
’tis nothing, nothing; it will soon pass away
come, come
no, no; thanks. you need not look for it; i do not want it
yes, yes, father, tell me where it is
it is no use
there is no wine.
what, no wine?
i want nothing now that i have you
yet
well?
why, i paid him.
but
yes
and you paid him out of the two hundred francs i left you?
so that you have lived for three months on sixty francs
you know how little i require
heaven pardon me
what are you doing?
you have wounded me to the heart.
never mind it, for i see you once more
yes, here i am
whom does this belong to?
gently, gently
ah, lips that say one thing, while the heart thinks another
what, is it you, edmond, back again?
we are never quits with those who oblige us
‘why, with his father, no doubt,’ replied danglars. and so i came
worthy caderousse!
he is so much attached to us.
eh
no, my boy, no
it was offered with good will
m. morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me
then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him.
what, did you refuse to dine with him?
yes, my dear father
and why did you refuse, my son?
that i might the sooner see you again, my dear father
i was most anxious to see you.
but it must have vexed m. morrel, good, worthy man
but i explained to him the cause of my refusal
i hope to be captain without that
mercédès?
go, my dear boy
his wife!
no, but according to all probability she soon will be
yes—yes
and why?
really?
ah, yes
meaning to say
that if i were not a captain——
eh—eh!
come, come
so much the better—so much the better
i will go directly
well
did you see him?
i have just left him
did he allude to his hope of being captain?
he spoke of it as a thing already decided.
indeed!
he is in too much hurry, it appears to me.
why, it seems m. morrel has promised him the thing.
so that he is quite elated about it?
which you refused?
pooh!
he is not one yet.
_ma foi!_ it will be as well if he is not
if we choose
what do you mean?
explain yourself.
why should i?
it is more important than you think, perhaps. you do not like dantès?
i never like upstarts.
then tell me all you know about the catalane.
what have you seen?—come, tell me!
really; and you think this cousin pays her attentions?
and you say that dantès has gone to the catalans?
he went before i came down.
come along
but you pay the score.
of course
you see, mercédès
at least it was not i who ever encouraged you in that hope, fernand
yes, that is very true, mercédès
fernand
i understand
what do you mean?
fernand
say, mercédès
i love edmond dantès
and you will always love him?
as long as i live.
but if he is dead——
if he is dead, i shall die too.
if he has forgotten you——
mercédès!
mercédès!
ah
ah, your pardon
who is this gentleman?
yes!
an enemy!
but you are deceived, edmond
oh
hallo, catalan! hallo, fernand! where are you running to?
well
particularly when they have still a full bottle before them
he seems besotted
why, we must inquire into that
good-day
you called me, didn’t you?
well, fernand, i must say
bah!
no
only hark how he sighs! come, come, fernand
my health is well enough
ah, you see, danglars
no; i do not understand
poor fernand has been dismissed
well, and what then?
oh, if you take it in that sense
a lover is never terrible
poor fellow!
ah, _ma foi_, under any circumstances!
no, you are right—and i should say that would bring him ill-luck.
well, never mind
and when is the wedding to be?
oh, it is not yet fixed!
no, but it will be
well
eh, eh, eh!
do you know them, fernand?
yes
it is edmond and mercédès!
ah, see there, now!
hold your tongue, will you?
i shall get nothing from these fools
hallo!
no, my dear fellow!
ah, very well, that’s an explanation!
we must excuse our worthy neighbor, caderousse
so, then, the wedding is to take place immediately, m. dantès
and fernand
my wife’s brother is my brother
danglars
your pardon
yes.
have you business there?
yes, yes, i understand
a pleasant journey
thank you
well, my dear sir
it drives me to despair
do you, then, love mercédès?
i adore her!
for long?
as long as i have known her—always.
what would you have me do?
i have found already.
what?
pooh! women say those things, but never do them.
you do not know mercédès; what she threatens she will do.
idiot!
before mercédès should die
i would die myself!
that’s what i call love!
that’s love, or i don’t know what love is.
come
yes
but how?
my dear fellow
i—drunk!
you were saying, sir——
you said, sir, you would like to help me, but——
death alone can separate them
you talk like a noodle, my friend
let him run on
yes; but one gets out of prison
what matters that?
and why, i should like to know
hold your tongue!
i won’t hold my tongue!
i know not why you meddle
no, no
and who has said a word about killing him, muddlehead?
we were merely joking; drink to his health
and do not interfere with us.
yes, yes, dantès’ good health!
here’s to his health! his health—hurrah!
but the means—the means?
have you not hit upon any?
no!—you undertook to do so.
true
do you invent, then
waiter
pen, ink, and paper.
pen, ink, and paper
pen, ink, and paper, then
there’s what you want on that table
bring them here.
when one thinks
the fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be
well!
well, then, i should say, for instance
i will denounce him!
true!
no, no
very good
yes, and that’s all settled!
yes
all right!
and who thinks of using him ill? certainly neither i nor fernand
in this case
you have had too much already, drunkard
i?
done!
very well, let us go
no
i shall return to the catalans.
you’re wrong. come with us to marseilles—come along.
i will not.
well
oh, you don’t see straight
well
come, come
father
fruits of the sea.
a pretty silence truly!
ah
the truth is
why, what ails you?
and that is the very thing that alarms me
nay, nay!
in an hour?
why, thus it is
upon my word
but
the contract
no, no
upon my word
oh, there was no harm meant
certainly
shall we not set forth?
to be sure!—to be sure!
let us go directly!
i demand admittance
may i venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit?
if it be so
i am he; what is your pleasure with me?
edmond dantès
me!
what is the meaning of all this?
how can i tell you?
so, so
nonsense
no, you did not!
where is fernand?
how do i know?
oh, to be sure!
nothing more than a mistake, i feel quite certain.
adieu, adieu, dearest edmond!
wait for me here, all of you!
that’s right!
he is the cause of all this misery—i am quite sure of it
i don’t think so
you don’t mention those who aided and abetted the deed
surely
what think you, danglars
of this event?
why
now i recollect
there, you see
come, come
hope!
hope!
good news! good news!
what news?
alas, my friends
the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than i expected.
oh, indeed—indeed, sir, he is innocent!
that i believe!
but still he is charged——
with what?
with being an agent of the bonapartist faction!
ah, danglars!
be silent, you simpleton!
suppose we wait a while, and see what comes of it
to be sure!
let us go, then. i cannot stay here any longer.
with all my heart!
could you ever have credited such a thing, my dear danglars?
why, you know i told you
and did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself?
certainly not!
’tis well, danglars—’tis well!
is it possible you were so kind?
and what was his reply?
the hypocrite!
poor dantès!
but meanwhile
oh
no doubt; but in the meantime?
i am entirely at your service, m. morrel
perhaps not
well, well
you see
oh, no
then you were aware of dantès being engaged in a conspiracy?
still
amen!
so far, then
she will take her own.
_vive napoléons_
ah
marquise, marquise!
never mind, dearest mother
never mind, renée
they had, however, what supplied the place of those fine qualities
he!
’tis true, madame
true
dear mother
suffer me, also, madame
bravo, villefort!
with all my heart
alas, madame
do you, indeed, think so?
you have heard, perhaps
that the holy alliance purpose removing him from thence?
yes; they were talking about it when we left paris
and where is it decided to transfer him?
to saint helena.
for heaven’s sake, where is that?
unfortunately
oh, well, we shall find some way out of it
well
unfortunately, madame
then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it.
oh, m. de villefort
amusing, certainly
for shame, m. de villefort!
gracious heavens, m. de villefort
you surely are not in earnest.
indeed i am
bravo!
just the person we require at a time like the present
oh, as for parricides, and such dreadful people as that
i don’t know anything about that
make yourself quite easy on that point
my love
_cedant arma togæ_
i cannot speak latin
well
dear, good renée
let us hope, my child
madame
do you know, my dear villefort
that is true
that is right
for my part, dear mother
you were wishing just now
and wherefore were you called away just now?
how dreadful!
is it possible?
can i believe my ears?
i will read you the letter containing the accusation, at least
but
then the guilty person is absolutely in custody?
he is in safe custody
and where is the unfortunate being?
he is at my house.
come, come, my friend
oh, villefort!
never mind that foolish girl, villefort
these are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal
upon my word, child!
oh, mother!
oh, no, monsieur, he is very young.
how old?
nineteen or twenty at the most.
ah, m. de villefort
i know it, monsieur
oh
ah, ah
bring in the prisoner.
who and what are you?
the accused
my name is edmond dantès
your age?
nineteen
what were you doing at the moment you were arrested?
i was at the festival of my marriage, monsieur
you were at the festival of your marriage?
go on, sir
what would you have me say?
give all the information in your power.
i warn you i know very little.
have you served under the usurper?
i was about to be mustered into the royal marines when he fell.
it is reported your political opinions are extreme
my political opinions!
pardieu!
sir
have you any enemies, at least, that you know.
i have enemies?
now
speak, monsieur
and what did you do then?
ah
i am free, then, sir?
yes; but first give me this letter.
stop a moment
to whom is it addressed?
to monsieur noirtier, rue coq-héron, paris.
m. noirtier, rue coq-héron, no. 13
yes
do you know him?
no
it is a conspiracy, then?
yes; but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed
i was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it.
have you shown this letter to anyone?
to no one, on my honor.
everybody, except the person who gave it to me.
and that was too much, far too much
oh
what is the matter?
and you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter?
i give you my word of honor, sir
no
monsieur
oh, if he knows the contents of this!
oh, it is impossible to doubt it
in heaven’s name!
sir
oh, monsieur
you see, i destroy it?
oh
you are goodness itself.
listen
oh, command, and i will obey.
listen; this is not a command, but advice i give you.
speak, and i will follow your advice.
i promise.
you see
be satisfied; i will deny it.
it was the only letter you had?
it was.
swear it.
i swear it.
follow him
alas, alas
this will do
are you come to fetch me?
yes
by the orders of the deputy procureur?
i believe so.
is this carriage for me?
it is for you
can all this force be summoned on my account?
whither are you taking me?
you will soon know.
but still——
we are forbidden to give you any explanation.
comrade
i see no great harm in telling him now
on my honor, i have no idea.
have you no idea whatever?
none at all.
that is impossible.
i swear to you it is true. tell me, i entreat.
but my orders.
i do not.
look round you then.
the château d’if?
what are we going there for?
i am not going there to be imprisoned
there are only
you think, then
it is probable; but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard.
without any inquiry, without any formality?
and so, in spite of m. de villefort’s promises?
i do not know what m. de villefort promised you
good!
where is the prisoner?
here
let him follow me; i will take him to his cell.
go!
here is your chamber for tonight
have you not slept?
i do not know
are you hungry?
i do not know.
do you wish for anything?
i wish to see the governor.
well
are you more reasonable today?
come, cheer up; is there anything that i can do for you?
i wish to see the governor.
i have already told you it was impossible.
why so?
what is allowed, then?
better fare, if you pay for it, books, and leave to walk about.
well, then
but
how long shall i have to wait?
ah, a month—six months—a year.
it is too long a time. i wish to see him at once.
ah
you think so?
how long has he left it?
two years.
was he liberated, then?
no; he was put in a dungeon.
listen!
what is that?
well
threats!
all right, all right
very well
by the governor’s orders
to the dungeon, then
yes; we must put the madman with the madmen.
speak out.
are we threatened with a fresh reign of terror?
has the corsican ogre broken loose?
marquise
ah, it is really a serious matter, then?
so serious that i must take leave of you for a few days; so
judge for yourself if it be not important.
you are going to leave us?
alas
i must!
where, then, are you going?
you wish to speak to me alone?
yes, let us go to the library, please.
well
then sell out—sell out, marquis, or you will lose it all.
but how can i sell out here?
you have a broker, have you not?
yes.
the deuce you say!
let us lose no time, then!
now, then
to whom?
to the king.
to the king?
yes.
i dare not write to his majesty.
tell your coachman to stop at the door.
you will find them both here, and can make your farewells in person.
a thousand thanks—and now for the letter.
say to the comte de salvieux that i would like to see him.
now, then, go
i shall be gone only a few moments.
the young man you speak of
i do not know; he is no longer in my hands
ah, you are there
i have not quitted you since yesterday
you say, sir——
that i am exceedingly disquieted, sire.
then of what other scourge are you afraid, my dear blacas?
well, my dear duke
sire
_canimus surdis_
sire
by whom?
by bonaparte, or, at least, by his adherents.
my dear blacas
and you, sire, prevent me from sleeping with your security.
go on, my dear duke, go on—i listen.
sire
_mala ducis avi domum_
does your majesty wish me to drop the subject?
by no means, my dear duke; but just stretch out your hand.
which?
whichever you please—there to the left.
here, sire?
come in
has your majesty perused yesterday’s report?
monsieur
bonaparte
and scratches himself for amusement
scratches himself?
what does your majesty mean?
and, moreover, my dear duke
insane?
or of wisdom, my dear baron—or of wisdom
well, well, dandré
the usurper’s conversion!
decidedly, my dear duke.
in what way converted?
to good principles. tell him all about it, baron.
why, this is the way of it
well, blacas, what think you of this?
go thither, and if there be none—well, well
make one; that is the usual way, is it not?
oh, sire
well, sir, go
i will but go and return, sire; i shall be back in ten minutes.
and i, sire
will go and find my messenger.
wait, sir, wait
sire, i listen
m. de salvieux, my brother’s chamberlain?
yes, sire.
he is at marseilles.
and writes me thence.
does he speak to you of this conspiracy?
m. de villefort!
yes, sire.
and he comes from marseilles?
in person.
why did you not mention his name at once?
sire, i thought his name was unknown to your majesty.
his father?
yes, noirtier.
noirtier the girondin?—noirtier the senator?
he himself.
and your majesty has employed the son of such a man?
then, sire, may i present him?
this instant, duke! where is he?
waiting below, in my carriage.
seek him at once.
i hasten to do so.
_justum et tenacem propositi virum_.
come in, m. de villefort
come in.
m. de villefort
speak as fully as you please, sir
sire
i am, sir
and where is this man?
in prison, sire.
and the matter seems serious to you?
true
daughter of one of your majesty’s most faithful servants.
yes, yes; but let us talk of this plot, m. de villefort.
sire, i fear it is more than a plot; i fear it is a conspiracy.
a conspiracy in these times
ah, here is m. dandré!
what ails you, baron?
sire,——
well, what is it?
will you speak?
monsieur
i command you to speak.
and where? in italy?
in france, sire,—at a small port, near antibes, in the gulf of juan.
alas, sire, it is but too true!
in france!
oh, sire
but——
your pardon, sire
speak, sir, speak boldly
sire
yes, assuredly
advancing—he is advancing!
and dauphiné, sir?
then
i do not know, sire
and how did this despatch reach you?
by the telegraph, sire.
so then
sire, it is fatality!
to fall
sire, sire
for pity’s——
approach, m. de villefort
i do not mean that for you, blacas
sire
’tis well
and now, gentlemen
fortunately, sire
the affair in the rue saint-jacques!
go on, go on, sir
sire
on the contrary, sir,—on the contrary
everything points to the conclusion, sire
it is probable, sire
they are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him.
on his track?
continue to seek for this man, sir
how strange
no, sire
but you have seen him?
sire, i went straight to the duc de blacas.
but you will see him, then?
i think not, sire.
ah, i forgot
in the meanwhile take this cross.
sire
_ma foi!_
and now
sire
go, sir
ah, sir
you entered by luck’s door—your fortune is made.
will it be long first?
who could know that i was here already?
well
what is it?—who rang?—who asked for me?
a stranger who will not send in his name.
a stranger who will not send in his name! what can he want with me?
he wishes to speak to you.
to me?
yes.
did he mention my name?
yes.
what sort of person is he?
why, sir, a man of about fifty.
short or tall?
about your own height, sir.
dark or fair?
dark,—very dark; with black eyes, black hair, black eyebrows.
and how dressed?
it is he!
eh, _pardieu!_
father!
well, then, if you felt so sure
leave us, germain
well, now, my dear gérard
my dear father
but, my dear fellow
and if i have come, my dear father
ah, indeed!
no. 53; yes, i am vice-president.
father, your coolness makes me shudder.
and who told you this fine story?
the king himself.
well, then, in return for your story
my dear father, i think i already know what you are about to tell me.
ah, you have heard of the landing of the emperor?
no matter, i was aware of his intention.
how did you know about it?
by a letter addressed to you from the island of elba.
to me?
come, come
and the destruction of your future prospects
i do better than that, sir—i save you.
i must refer again to the club in the rue saint-jacques.
they have not found; but they are on the track.
and who thus designated it?
the king himself.
i do not understand you.
you rely on the usurper’s return?
we do.
the people will rise.
yes, to go and meet him.
indeed!
you really do seem very well informed.
devotion!
wait, my dear father
one word more.
say on.
what is that?
ah, ha, that’s it, is it?
didn’t i say that your police were good for nothing?
yes; but they may catch him yet.
true
well
well, do you think your police will recognize me now.
no, father
at least, i hope not.
and now, my dear boy
oh, rely on me
you are not convinced yet?
i hope at least, that you may be mistaken.
shall you see the king again?
perhaps.
would you pass in his eyes for a prophet?
prophets of evil are not in favor at the court, father.
well, what should i say to the king?
moderation
m. morrel, i believe?
yes, sir.
come nearer
and tell me to what circumstance i owe the honor of this visit.
do you not guess, monsieur?
everything depends on you.
explain yourself, pray.
monsieur
tell me his name.
edmond dantès.
dantès
edmond dantès.
yes, monsieur.
are you quite sure you are not mistaken, monsieur?
no
monsieur
that’s right!
wait a moment
how so?
well?
carried off!
what can they have done with him?
do not be too hasty, m. morrel
but
there has been no arrest.
how?
it might be so under the bourbons, but at present——
well, m. de villefort, how would you advise me to act?
petition the minister.
and will you undertake to deliver it?
but how shall i address the minister?
sit down there
will you be so good?
certainly. but lose no time; we have lost too much already.
that will do
leave the rest to me.
will the petition go soon?
today.
countersigned by you?
what more is to be done?
i will do whatever is necessary.
my brother
yes; the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons.
let us visit them
let us first send for two soldiers
take all needful precautions
oh
who can live here?
he is alone?
certainly.
how long has he been there?
nearly a year.
was he placed here when he first arrived?
to kill the turnkey?
yes, the very one who is lighting us. is it not true, antoine?
true enough; he wanted to kill me!
he must be mad
he is worse than that,—he is a devil!
shall i complain of him?
so much the better for him,—he will suffer less
you are right, sir
i will see them both
let us visit this one first
by all means
what is it you want?
are you well fed?
you are very humble today
and you are not so any longer?
no; captivity has subdued me—i have been here so long.
so long?—when were you arrested, then?
the 28th of february, 1815, at half-past two in the afternoon.
today is the 30th of july, 1816,—why, it is but seventeen months.
only seventeen months
we shall see
certainly; but you will find terrible charges.
monsieur
go on with the lights
monsieur
i cannot tell you that
oh, i am free—then i am saved!
who arrested you?
m. villefort. see him, and hear what he says.
m. villefort is no longer at marseilles; he is now at toulouse.
i am no longer surprised at my detention
had m. de villefort any cause of personal dislike to you?
none; on the contrary, he was very kind to me.
i can, then, rely on the notes he has left concerning you?
entirely.
that is well; wait patiently, then.
will you see the register at once
let us visit them all
what is his folly?
how curious!—what is his name?
the abbé faria.
no. 27
it is here; unlock the door, antoine.
what is it you want?
i, monsieur
you do not understand
oh, that is different
there, now
it is just as i told you.
monsieur
why from the french government?
ah
you have not the latest news from italy?
my information dates from the day on which i was arrested
monsieur
we are coming to the point
it is for that reason i am delighted to see you
what did i tell you?
you knew him
what you ask is impossible, monsieur
but
the very sum you named
however
unfortunately
of course
of what else should i speak?
mr. inspector
that proves
my dear sir, the government is rich and does not want your treasures
keep them until you are liberated.
but what if i am not liberated
on my word
i am not mad
is the spot far from here?
a hundred leagues.
it is not ill-planned
the scheme is well known
i inquired if you are well fed?
swear to me
are you well fed?
you do not reply to my question
nor you to mine
what is he doing there?
counting his treasures
he was wealthy once, perhaps?
or dreamed he was, and awoke mad.
after all
sometimes
i wish to die
there can be no doubt about it
it is a prisoner
leave the saucepan
well, don’t you intend to bring me another plate?
no
oh, my god, my god!
who talks of god and despair at the same time?
ah
i hear a human voice.
in the name of heaven
who are you?
an unhappy prisoner
of what country?
a frenchman.
your name?
edmond dantès.
your profession?
a sailor.
how long have you been here?
since the 28th of february, 1815.
your crime?
i am innocent.
but of what are you accused?
of having conspired to aid the emperor’s return.
since 1811.
do not dig any more
on a level with the floor.
how is it concealed?
behind my bed.
has your bed been moved since you have been a prisoner?
no.
what does your chamber open on?
a corridor.
and the corridor?
on a court.
alas!
oh, what is the matter?
but then you would be close to the sea?
that is what i hoped.
and supposing you had succeeded?
could you have swum so far?
heaven would have given me strength; but now all is lost.
all?
tell me, at least, who you are?
i am—i am no. 27.
you mistrust me, then
oh, i am a christian
how old are you? your voice is that of a young man.
not quite twenty-six!
oh, no, no
how long?
i must calculate our chances; i will give you the signal.
no, i am alone in the world.
it is well
tomorrow.
is it you?
i am here.
is your jailer gone?
yes
i can work, then?
oh, yes, yes; this instant, i entreat you.
let us first see
why
do you possess any?
well, in the first place, here is my chisel.
and with what did you contrive to make that?
fifty feet!
but they believe i am shut up alone here.
that makes no difference.
that’s true
climb up
what was it that you thought?
yes
are you quite sure of that?
well?
then——
then
the will of god be done!
tell me, i entreat of you, who and what you are?
never have i met with so remarkable a person as yourself.
willingly
then listen
no, louis xviii.
yes, yes
you are young, you will see all this come to pass.
probably, if ever i get out of prison!
true
but wherefore are you here?
are you not
mad, you mean, don’t you?
i did not like to say so
well, then
then you abandon all hope of escape?
i have found what you were in search of!
have you, indeed?
pray, let me know what it is you have discovered?
it does.
and is not above fifteen feet from it?
about that.
one instant, my dear friend
and have your notions changed?
is it possible
tell me
simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me
because
since my imprisonment
ah
i assure you
what did you do then?
i wrote or studied.
were you then permitted the use of pens, ink, and paper?
oh, no
i had none but what i made for myself.
you made paper, pens and ink?
yes.
when you pay me a visit in my cell, my young friend
and on what have you written all this?
you are, then, a chemist?
somewhat; i know lavoisier, and was the intimate friend of cabanis.
but for such a work you must have needed books—had you any?
improve yourself!
but the ink
of what did you make your ink?
there was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon
and when
may i see all this?
whenever you please
oh, then let it be directly!
follow me, then
it is well
look at this ray of light which enters by my window
come
i am anxious to see your treasures.
what do you wish to see first?
oh, your great work on the monarchy of italy!
there
i see
look!
ah, yes
as for the ink
one thing still puzzles me
i worked at night also
you did? pray tell me how.
but how do you procure a light?
oh, here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen.
and matches?
you have not seen all yet
who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work?
and was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed?
with what?
with this needle
i once thought
what are you thinking of?
i was reflecting, in the first place
no
well
i did!
you have told me as yet but one of them—let me hear the other.
then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged?
come
let me hear your story.
there is
to no one, by heaven! i was a very insignificant person.
yes.
and about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl?
yes.
now we are getting on. and what was this man’s name?
danglars.
what rank did he hold on board?
he was supercargo.
no; we were quite alone.
could your conversation have been overheard by anyone?
that’s better
nobody.
yes; the grand marshal did.
and what did you do with that letter?
put it into my portfolio.
you are right; it was left on board.
no.
i carried it in my hand.
yes.
danglars, as well as the rest?
danglars, as well as others.
repeat it to me.
the thing is clear as day
do you really think so? ah, that would indeed be infamous.
how did danglars usually write?
in a handsome, running hand.
and how was the anonymous letter written?
backhanded.
disguised.
it was very boldly written, if disguised.
stop a bit
how very astonishing!
what?
you have evidently seen and observed everything.
let us proceed.
oh, yes, yes!
now as regards the second question.
i am listening.
yes; a young man who loved her.
and his name was——
fernand.
that is a spanish name, i think?
he was a catalan.
you imagine him capable of writing the letter?
besides
you had never spoken of them yourself to anyone?
to no one.
not even to your mistress?
no, not even to my betrothed.
then it is danglars.
i feel quite sure of it now.
wait a little. pray, was danglars acquainted with fernand?
no—yes, he was. now i recollect——
what?
were they alone?
yes, yes
that is altogether a different and more serious matter
the deputy.
was he young or old?
about six or seven-and-twenty years of age, i should say.
so
with more of mildness than severity.
did you tell him your whole story?
i did.
and did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination?
by your misfortune?
yes.
then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored?
he gave me one great proof of his sympathy, at any rate.
and that?
he burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me.
what? the accusation?
no; the letter.
are you sure?
i saw it done.
upon my word
never mind; let us go on.
with all my heart! you tell me he burned the letter?
this action is somewhat too sublime to be natural.
you think so?
i am sure of it. to whom was this letter addressed?
to m. noirtier, rue coq-héron, no. 13, paris.
noirtier!
de villefort!
what ails you?
do you see that ray of sunlight?
i do.
he did.
and the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter?
yes.
and then made you swear never to utter the name of noirtier?
yes.
yes, his father
i regret now
why so?
let us talk of something else
you must teach me a small part of what you know
alas, my boy
two years!
but cannot one learn philosophy?
well, then
everything
ah, if there were no sentinel!
there shall not be one a minute longer than you please
i have already told you
no matter! i could never agree to it.
still, you have thought of it?
incessantly, alas!
he shall be both blind and deaf
no, no
impossible!
are you strong?
i promise on my honor.
then
we may hope to put our design into execution.
and how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work?
at least a year.
and shall we begin at once?
at once.
we have lost a year to no purpose!
do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted?
forgive me!
tut, tut!
gracious heavens!
quick! quick!
listen to what i have to say.
tell me, i beseech you, what ails you?
alas
thanks
perhaps!
help! help!
i—i—die—i——
he is saved! he is saved!
i did not expect to see you again
and why not?
did you fancy yourself dying?
without you? did you really think me capable of that?
at least
be of good cheer
your strength will return.
the last attack i had
no, no
my good edmond
i shall never swim again
you are convinced now, edmond, are you not?
the physician may be mistaken!
my son
it is well
then i shall also remain.
thanks
what is that?
look at it
i have looked at it with all possible attention
this paper, my friend
your treasure?
yes
alas
on the contrary, it is a matter of the utmost importance, edmond!
you persist in your incredulity, edmond
tomorrow, my dear friend
i will not irritate him
25th april, 149’
well!
why
and do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning?
silence!
steps approach—i go—adieu!
here i am, pursuing you remorselessly
you know
up to this point
this seems to you very meaningless, no doubt, eh?
oh, my friend
and now
read this other paper;
and now
put the two fragments together, and judge for yourself.
25th april, 1498. “cæs...ar † spada.
well, do you comprehend now?
yes; a thousand times, yes!
and who completed it as it now is?
and what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion?
now
but
and you say this treasure amounts to——
two millions of roman crowns; nearly thirteen millions of our money.
impossible!
impossible? and why?
i have only kept this secret so long from you
this treasure belongs to you, my dear friend
you are my son, dantès
you see
alas
can it be?
alas, my dear friend
help, help!
silence
see
there is not a hope
oh, yes, yes!
oh!
and now, my dear friend
adieu, adieu!
adieu!
oh, no,—no, not yet
hush! hush!
monte cristo, forget not monte cristo!
well, well
with all his millions, he will not have enough to pay for his shroud!
oh
perhaps
they may give him the honors of the sack.
i am very sorry for what you tell me
ah
still
you may make your mind easy
you know, sir
let the irons be heated
here is the brazier, lighted.
you see, sir, he is really dead
wasn’t his name faria?
it is the sort of malady which we call monomania
you had never anything to complain of?
never, sir
ah, ah!
must this last formality take place in your presence, sir?
certainly. but make haste—i cannot stay here all day.
this evening
will there be any mass?
that is impossible
pooh, pooh;
this evening
at what hour?
why, about ten or eleven o’clock.
shall we watch by the corpse?
if i could die
die? oh, no
just god!
he’s heavy, though, for an old and thin man
they say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones
have you tied the knot?
what would be the use of carrying so much more weight?
i can do that when we get there.
yes, you’re right
what’s the knot for?
where am i?
really, he is by no means a light load!
give us a light
what can he be looking for?
the spade, perhaps.
here it is at last
yes
but it has lost nothing by waiting.
well, have you tied the knot?
yes, and pretty tight too, i can tell you
move on, then.
bad weather!
why, yes, the abbé runs a chance of being wet
well, here we are at last
a little farther—a little farther
one!
two! three!
let us see
well
in two or three hours
oh
i am saved!
courage!
courage!
who are you?
i am
where do you come from?
it was i
yes
i thank you again.
i almost hesitated, though
yes
now what are we to do with you?
do you know the mediterranean?
i have sailed over it since my childhood.
you know the best harbors?
i say, captain
courage!
if what he says is true, what hinders his staying with us?
if he says true
i will do more than i promise
we shall see
where are you going?
to leghorn.
because we should run straight on to the island of rion.
you shall pass it by twenty fathoms.
take the helm, and let us see what you know.
to the sheets
haul taut.
belay.
bravo!
bravo!
you see
ah
give me what you give the others, and it will be all right
that’s not fair
what is that to you, jacopo?
that’s true
i only make a remark.
no
but i have a shirt and a pair of trousers.
that is all i want
now, then, do you wish for anything else?
larboard your helm
hollo! what’s the matter at the château d’if?
what is this?
at any rate
what is the day of the month?
the 28th of february.
in what year?
in what year—you ask me in what year?
yes
i ask you in what year!
you have forgotten then?
i got such a fright last night
the year 1829
pump
pain, thou art not an evil.
where shall we pass the night?
why, on board the tartan
should we not do better in the grottos?
what grottos?
why, the grottos—caves of the island.
i do not know of any grottos
what, are there no grottos at monte cristo?
none.
in two hours’ time
he has broken his ribs
well
no, no
but you’ll die of hunger
i would rather do so
what are we to do, maltese?
go, go!
we shall be absent at least a week
why
listen, captain baldi; there’s one way of settling this
do you go, and i will stay and take care of the wounded man.
and give up your share of the venture
yes
and without any hesitation.
you are a good fellow and a kind-hearted messmate
and now
now, open sesame!
come
but what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret?
the fate
yet, had he come
perhaps!
alas
in the farthest angle of the second opening
it is a casket of wood bound with iron
i beg your pardon, sir
some nabob from india
hush, la carconte. it is god’s pleasure that things should be so.
you are welcome, sir, most welcome!
now, then, margotin
yes, sir
gaspard caderousse
i did.
and you followed the business of a tailor?
as you please, sir
are you quite alone?
quite, quite alone
you are married, then?
ah, sir
yes, honest—i can certainly say that much for myself
so much the better for you, if what you assert be true
such words as those belong to your profession
and you do well to repeat them; but
you are wrong to speak thus
what mean you?
what proofs do you require?
you remind me
said to bear the name!
poor fellow, poor fellow!
you speak as though you had loved this young dantès
and so i did
you knew the poor lad, then?
and of what did he die?
but the strangest part of the story is
and so he was
a rich englishman
then, i suppose
why, everything is relative
bless me!
no
and that diamond
you say, is worth fifty thousand francs?
it is, without the setting, which is also valuable
‘another of the number,’
mercédès
true
mercédès it was.
go on
bring me a _carafe_ of water
where did we leave off?
the name of edmond’s betrothed was mercédès.
perfectly.
but why into five parts?
too true, too true!
the poor old man did die.
i learned so much at marseilles
i do not know who could if i could not
of what did he die?
of what?
why, of downright starvation.
starvation!
what i have said, i have said
and you are a fool for having said anything about it
mind your own business, wife
politeness, you simpleton!
i pledge you my word, madam
ah, that’s all very fine
why, he was not altogether forsaken
and was he not so?
gaspard, gaspard!
mind what you are saying!
imbecile!
do you, then, know in what manner fernand injured dantès?
do i? no one better.
speak out then, say what it was!
gaspard!
well, wife
i don’t know but what you’re right!
so you will say nothing?
why, what good would it do?
you prefer, then
that is true enough
remember
how so?
do you not know their history?
i do not. pray relate it to me!
well, my good friend
wife, wife!
come here!
diamond!
what diamond are you talking about?
why, did you not hear all we said?
oh, what a magnificent jewel!
it does
and why among us four?
i don’t call those friends who betray and ruin you
of course not!
remember
there, you see, wife
do you believe it?
why, surely a man of his holy profession would not deceive us!
well
gaspard, consider well what you are about to do!
i have both reflected and decided
well
to tell you all i know
i certainly think you act wisely in so doing
i hope it may be so
i am all attention
stop a minute
remember, this is no affair of mine
enough, enough!
you must make me a promise.
what is that?
make yourself easy, my friend
well, then, under these circumstances
begin with his father, if you please.
the history is a sad one, sir
perhaps you know all the earlier part of it?
yes.
at la réserve! oh, yes; i can see it all before me this moment.
was it not his betrothal feast?
yes, and up to this point i know all
but did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man?
ah, sir
poor father!
the story interests you, does it not, sir?
yes
it is very affecting.
and you believe he died——
of hunger, sir, of hunger
this was, indeed, a horrid event
the more so, sir, as it was men’s and not god’s doing.
tell me of those men
and remember too
how was this jealousy manifested? speak on.
they denounced edmond as a bonapartist agent.
which of the two denounced him? which was the real delinquent?
both, sir; one with a letter, and the other put it in the post.
and where was this letter written?
at la réserve, the day before the betrothal feast.
’twas so, then—’twas so, then
what did you please to say, sir?
nothing, nothing
go on.
but
you were there yourself.
i!
who told you i was there?
true, true!
i was there.
and did you not remonstrate against such infamy?
sir
i understand—you allowed matters to take their course, that was all.
yes, sir
well, sir
unfortunately, edmond is dead, and has not pardoned me.
he did not know
but he knows it all now
you have two or three times mentioned a m. morrel
the owner of the _pharaon_ and patron of dantès.
and what part did he play in this sad drama?
and
is m. morrel still alive?
yes
in that case
yes, happy as myself
what! m. morrel unhappy?
how?
yes
and has the unfortunate man wife or children?
horrible!
and it is thus heaven recompenses virtue, sir
how is that?
ah!
he is happy.
and fernand?
fernand? why, much the same story.
both, sir—he has both fortune and position—both.
this must be impossible!
destiny! destiny!
so that now——?
so that now
disappeared
has she made a fortune also?
mercédès is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in paris
go on
so that
‘frailty, thy name is woman.’
six months afterwards
the very church in which she was to have married edmond
there was only a change of bridegrooms.
well, mercédès was married
did you ever see mercédès again?
her son?
yes
little albert.
but, then, to be able to instruct her child
oh
and yet what?
yet, i am sure, she is not happy
what makes you believe this?
then you did not see either of them?
no, but madame de morcerf saw me.
how was that?
and m. de villefort?
you are mistaken, my friend
here, my friend, take this diamond, it is yours.
what, for me only?
ah, sir, do not jest with me!
oh, sir
in exchange
oh, you are a man of god, sir
which
you would have done.
well
see, sir
’tis well
is, then, all that i have heard really true?
what? that he has given the diamond to us only?
yes, nothing more true! see, here it is.
suppose it’s false?
false!
to get your secret without paying for it, you blockhead!
oh!
we will soon find out.
in what way?
fifty thousand francs!
sir
sir
oh, sir
but
it looks more like bankruptcy!
to tell you the truth, i consider it lost.
well, then, i will buy it of you!
you?
yes, i!
but at a tremendous discount, of course?
no, for two hundred thousand francs. our house
does not do things in that way.
and you will pay——
ready money.
that’s no affair of mine
of course, that is perfectly just
sir
name it, sir, i beg.
you are the inspector of prisons?
i have been so these fourteen years.
you keep the registers of entries and departures?
i do.
to these registers there are added notes relative to the prisoners?
there are special reports on every prisoner.
what was his name?
the abbé faria.
oh, i recollect him perfectly
he was crazy.
so they said.
oh, he was, decidedly.
very possibly; but what sort of madness was it?
poor devil!—and he is dead?
yes, sir, five or six months ago, last february.
you have a good memory, sir, to recollect dates so well.
may i ask what that was?
indeed!
yes
and you say, sir
that the two dungeons——
this dangerous man’s name was——
this tunnel was dug, no doubt, with an intention of escape?
that must have cut short the projects of escape.
for the dead man, yes
it was a bold step, and one that showed some courage
how was that?
how? do you not comprehend?
no.
well?
really!
yes, sir
that would have been difficult.
no matter
so can i
at the end of his teeth.
and so
unquestionably.
precisely.
but some official document was drawn up as to this affair, i suppose?
oh, yes; and they may have the fact attested whenever they please.
so be it
but to return to these registers.
true, this story has diverted our attention from them. excuse me.
yes, you will much oblige me.
go into my study here, and i will show it to you.
marseilles, 27th february, delivery 6 o’clock, p.m.
thanks
cocles
cock-eye
thanks, cocles; you are the pearl of cashiers.
m. morrel is in his room, is he not, mademoiselle julie?
yes; i think so, at least
it will be useless to announce me, mademoiselle
monsieur
you wish to speak to me?
yes, monsieur; you are aware from whom i come?
the house of thomson & french; at least, so my cashier tells me.
so then, sir
you hold bills of mine?
yes, and for a considerable sum.
what is the amount?
here is
when are you to pay?
half the 15th of this month, half the 15th of next.
i recognize them
is this all?
yes, sir
i will not
sir
i know that
to questions frankly put
well
if this last resource fail you?
well
have you no friends who could assist you?
in business, sir
one has no friends, only correspondents.
it is true
then you have but one hope.
but one.
the last?
the last.
so that if this fail——
i am ruined,—completely ruined!
as i was on my way here, a vessel was coming into port.
and it is not yours?
what is that?
oh, my god!
what is it?
there are only two persons who have the key to that door
cocles and julie.
oh, father!
oh, father, father!
courage!
the _pharaon_ has gone down, then?
and the crew?
saved
thanks, my god
at least thou strikest but me alone.
come in, come in
how did this happen?
draw nearer, penelon
and tell us all about it.
good-day, m. morrel
good-day, penelon
where is the captain?
well, now tell your story, penelon.
you see, m. morrel
that was not enough for those latitudes
we did better than that, sir
the vessel was very old to risk that
well done!
there’s nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons
well, well
oh, don’t let us talk of that, m. morrel.
yes, but we will talk of it.
well, then, three months
cocles, pay two hundred francs to each of these good fellows
at another time
as for that, m. morrel
as for what?
the money.
well——
thanks, my friends, thanks!
what, m. morrel!
no, no
no more ships!
i have no money to build ships with, penelon
so i cannot accept your kind offer.
enough, enough!
at least, we shall see each other again, m. morrel?
yes; i hope so, at least. now go.
now
well, sir
i see
oh, sir!
let me see
your bills, at least, are the first that will fall due.
do you wish for time to pay?
a delay would save my honor, and consequently my life.
how long a delay do you wish for?
two months
i will give you three
but
will the house of thomson & french consent?
oh, i take everything on myself. today is the 5th of june.
yes.
i shall expect you
oh, sir
mademoiselle
yes, sir
do you promise?
i swear to you i will.
i wish to speak to you.
worthy fellows!
then
we are indeed ruined.
the stoic.
he is writing
what have i done wrong, father
nothing, my dear
nothing, only i want it.
do not give this key to your father
remain with your mother, dearest.
maximilian, my dearest brother!
mother
julie
are you not mademoiselle julie morrel?
yes, sir
read this letter
sinbad the sailor.
you must go, then, mademoiselle
go there?
yes; i will accompany you.
but did you not read that i must be alone?
and you shall be alone
then, emmanuel?
yes. did not the messenger say your father’s safety depended upon it?
but what danger threatens him, then, emmanuel?
listen
today is the 5th of september, is it not?
yes.
yes, we know that.
well, then
what will happen then?
oh, come, then, come!
father
oh, this is what i feared!
father, father, in heaven’s name
maximilian
read!
i have
you have no money coming in on which you can rely?
none.
you have exhausted every resource?
all.
and in half an hour
blood washes out dishonor
you are right, father; i understand you.
father
yes, i do so bid you
be it so, then, my father
die in peace, my father; i will live.
you know it is not my fault
my father
bless me!
my father, my father!
why should you not live?
and now
will you not see my sister once more?
have you no particular commands to leave with me, my father?
yes; my son, and a sacred command.
say it, my father.
father, i will
and now, once more, adieu
hear me, maximilian
yes, yes
yes;
be it so, my father.
my worthy cocles
the agent of thomson & french.
my father!
saved, you are saved!
saved, my child!
what do you mean?
yes, saved—saved! see, see!
explain, my child
explain, my child
explain—where did you find this purse?
but
this purse is not yours!
and did you go alone?
monsieur morrel!
monsieur morrel!
it is his voice!
the _pharaon_!
the _pharaon_!
father
my dear friends
ah, sir
what can it mean?—the _pharaon_?
come, dear ones
the _pharaon_! the _pharaon_!
jacopo, jacopo, jacopo!
and now
to the island of elba!
ah, if your excellency chose
where?
do you see that island?
well, what is this island?
the island of monte cristo.
but i have no permission to shoot over this island.
ah, indeed!
to whom does this island belong?
to tuscany.
what game shall i find there!
thousands of wild goats.
who live upon the stones, i suppose
where can i sleep?
well
what now? is there any difficulty in the way?
no.
what do you mean?
but who will say your excellency has been to monte cristo?
oh, i shall not
nor i, nor i
then steer for monte cristo.
gaetano
yes, your excellency, and it is true.
oh, yes, i heard that.
but
why?
yes, why?
bah!
i did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project
what is this light?
hush!
it is a fire.
but you told me the island was uninhabited?
and for pirates?
and for pirates
but this fire?
oh, that goes for nothing
that is what we must find out
how can you find out?
you shall see.
well?
they are spanish smugglers
alas
ah!
then you are a smuggler occasionally, gaetano?
your excellency, we must live somehow
then you know the men who are now on monte cristo?
and do you think we have nothing to fear if we land?
nothing at all; smugglers are not thieves.
but these two corsican bandits?
how so?
what do you mean by having made a stiff?—having assassinated a man?
well
without doubt.
how many are they?
four, and the two bandits make six.
yes, but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions.
silence, then!
who comes there?
will your excellency give your name, or remain _incognito_?
my name must rest unknown
_s’accommodi_.
not that way, if you please.
besides
you are a born diplomat
go and try.
well
anything new?—do they refuse?
on the contrary
well
his house? has he built one here, then?
no, but he has a very comfortable one all the same, so they say.
you know this chief, then?
i have heard talk of him.
favorably or otherwise?
both.
the deuce!—and what is this condition?
ah
what should you do in my place?
i, who have nothing to lose,—i should go.
you would accept?
yes, were it only out of curiosity.
there is something very peculiar about this chief, then?
listen
what do they say?
what nonsense!
do you know
i tell you what i have been told.
then you advise me to accept?
never mind that
i know their vessel.
is it a very beautiful vessel?
i would not wish for a better to sail round the world.
of what burden is she?
where was she built?
i know not; but my own opinion is she is a genoese.
and how did a leader of smugglers
i did not say that the owner was a smuggler
no; but gaetano did, i thought.
and if this person be not a smuggler, who is he?
a wealthy signor, who travels for his pleasure.
come
what is his name?
sinbad the sailor?
yes.
and where does he reside?
on the sea.
what country does he come from?
i do not know.
have you ever seen him?
sometimes.
what sort of a man is he?
your excellency will judge for yourself.
where will he receive me?
no doubt in the subterranean palace gaetano told you of.
decidedly
this is an arabian nights’ adventure.
his excellency waits for you
welcome, sir. i beg you will remove your bandage.
sir
_ma foi_, my dear sir
now
and i
well, then, signor aladdin
yes
would it be impertinent, signor sinbad
oh, they are simple enough
and like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed
you have suffered a great deal, sir?
everything
revenge, for instance!
and why revenge?
because
ah!
and will that be the first time you ever took that journey?
and do you propose to make this journey very shortly?
i should avail myself of your offer with pleasure
you cannot guess
no, i really cannot.
but
ah, thus it is that our material origin is revealed
what, then, is this precious stuff?
did you ever hear
of course i have.
then
it is hashish! i know that—by name at least.
do you know
_diable!_
how do you take it?
i will take it in the turkish style
and you are right
_ma foi_
so, then, gaetano
there, do you hear?
he is bidding you adieu.
what are your excellency’s orders?
in the first place, light me a torch.
ah, yes, i understand
and give it to his excellency.
why
don’t you remember
true; and he is going to land them
precisely so
and what cares he for that
very good, signor pastrini
as to supper
what as to the carriage?
sir
and when shall we know?
tomorrow morning
there are no horses.
do you understand that, my dear franz—no horses?
what are we to say to this?
yes, your excellency.
well, then, let us sup.
but the carriage and horses?
well, excellency
yes
for the very three days it is most needed.
what is the matter?
no carriage to be had?
just so
you have guessed it.
well, your eternal city is a nice sort of place.
that is to say, excellency
ah, that is something
ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive
my friend
at least we can have a window?
where?
in the corso.
ah, a window!
well
ah, the devil, no
_parbleu!_
but, excellency
now go
do not give yourselves the trouble, excellency
and now we understand each other.
when do you wish the carriage to be here?
in an hour.
in an hour it will be at the door.
excellency
shall i bring the carriage nearer to the palace?
excellency
carriage
palace.
where do your excellencies wish to go?
to saint peter’s first, and then to the colosseum
excellency
did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage?
that is what all the french say
for that reason, i do not understand why they travel.
but
but
you had some motive for coming here, may i beg to know what it was?
ah, yes; you have ordered your carriage at eight o’clock precisely?
i have.
you intend visiting _il colosseo_.
you mean the colosseum?
these are my words exactly.
well, this route is impossible.
impossible!
very dangerous, to say the least.
dangerous!—and why?
on account of the famous luigi vampa.
pray, who may this famous luigi vampa be?
what! do you not know him?
i have not that honor.
you have never heard his name?
never.
now then, albert
here is a bandit for you at last.
excellency
albert does not say you are a liar, signor pastrini
but if your excellency doubt my veracity——
signor pastrini
this
why?
on your honor, is that true?
count
my dear fellow
and pray
i shared the same fate at aquapendente.
do you know, signor pastrini
what!
not make any resistance!
eh, _parbleu!_—they should kill me.
my dear albert
well, signor pastrini
let us see the watch
here it is
_peste!_
let us hear the history
your excellencies permit it?
_pardieu!_
you tell me
so
scarcely so much.
is he tall or short?
of the middle height—about the same stature as his excellency
thanks for the comparison
go on, signor pastrini
to what class of society does he belong?
‘and i replied, “very well, you shall have it.
‘i,’ said the traveller, ‘am called sinbad the sailor.’
sinbad the sailor?
yes
well, and what may you have to say against this name?
proceed!
well, my dear albert
i say he is a myth
and never had an existence.
and what may a myth be?
the explanation would be too long, my dear landlord
then the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him?
and how does he behave towards travellers?
well, albert
quite so
if the way be picturesque.
excellencies
the coach is ready.
well, then
let us to the colosseum.
by the porta del popolo or by the streets, your excellencies?
by the streets, _morbleu!_ by the streets!
ah, my dear fellow
really, i thought you had more courage.
sinbad the sailor
lions’ den
cæsar’s podium
i beg your excellency’s pardon for keeping you waiting
say not a word about being late
your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking
and who is beppo?
indeed! you are a provident person, i see.
briefly, what did you learn?
my good friend
and what do you mean to do?
and what is your excellency’s project?
and do you feel sure of succeeding?
_pardieu!_
what did your excellency say?
and how shall i know whether your excellency has succeeded or not.
your excellency
nay, i flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it
hush!
i hear a noise.
’tis some travellers, who are visiting the colosseum by torchlight.
well, then, if you obtain the reprieve?
and if you fail?
then all three windows will have yellow draperies.
and then?
sinbad the sailor.
nobility’s boxes
holy week
do you know the woman who has just entered that box?
yes; what do you think of her?
no; a venetian.
and her name is——
countess g——.
ah, i know her by name!
shall i assist you in repairing your negligence?
upon my word
you are mistaken in thinking so
no; of taste
and in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced?
you were with her, then?
i was.
and what did you say to her?
upon my word
and you will probably find your theme ill-chosen.
but
certainly, directly the curtain falls on the stage.
but what an awkward, inelegant fellow he is.
at least, you must admire moriani’s style and execution.
my good friend
all i can tell about her
and what do you think of her personal appearance?
bravos
countess
nay
i know no more of him than yourself.
perhaps you never before noticed him?
true
all i can say is
oh, he is always as colorless as you now see him
then you know him?
i fancy i have seen him before; and i even think he recognizes me.
and i can well understand
well.
why, that he is no other than lord ruthven himself in a living form.
i must positively find out who and what he is
no, no
is it possible
that you entertain any fear?
i’ll tell you
listen to me
excuse my little subterfuge
nay
what is it?
promise me, i say.
let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make
my dear fellow!
my dear albert
well, that tends to confirm my own ideas
he spoke the romaic language, did he?
i think so.
that settles it
’tis he, past all doubt.
what do you say?
oh, i was arranging a little surprise for you.
indeed. of what nature?
why, you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage.
i tell you what, m. franz
well, then, hearken to me.
i listen.
i do.
neither can we procure horses?
true; we have offered any sum, but have failed.
very possibly.
and a pair of oxen?
as easily found as the cart.
well
and quite a national one, too
and have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody?
and where is he now?
who?
our host.
gone out in search of our equipage, by tomorrow it might be too late.
then he will be able to give us an answer tonight.
oh, i expect him every minute.
_permesso_?
certainly—certainly
come in, my host.
now, then
better than that!
take care, my worthy host
let your excellencies only leave the matter to me
but what _have_ you done?
your excellencies are aware
i should think we did know it
but do you think
what sort of person is this count of monte cristo?
it seems to me
come in
faith, franz
tell the count
that is what i call an elegant mode of attack
then you accept his offer?
of course we do
pray, signor pastrini
oh, no
ah!
very possibly i may not go
what particulars would your excellency like to hear?
what are they?
why, your excellency
nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellency’s wish
now, my excellent signor pastrini
most assuredly
well, then, if it be so, are you ready, albert?
perfectly.
let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy.
yes, let us do so.
_i signori francesi_.
if your excellencies will please to be seated
well
what think you of all this?
hush, hush!
franz and i have to thank you a thousand times, count
indeed
count
ah
yes
did you ever occupy yourself
monsieur bertuccio
yes, excellency
but it was very late.
did i not tell you i wished for one?
ah!
there is no need to do that
will, i trust, do me the honor to breakfast with me?
but, my dear count
we shall abuse your kindness.
hum! ‘the first will be _mazzolato_, the second _decapitato_.’ yes
really?
for andrea rondolo?
no
really, count
there are, at least, few that i have not seen
and you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles?
curiosity—that is a terrible word.
i do not quite understand you
listen
yes, i know
i will put another case to you
yes
ah, duelling
then you disapprove of duelling? you would not fight a duel?
oh, yes
but
_al suo commodo!_
well
what are you doing?
you must excuse us, count
what may that be?
we have no masks, and it is absolutely necessary to procure them.
after the execution?
before or after, whichever you please.
opposite the scaffold?
the scaffold forms part of the _fête_.
count, i have reflected on the matter
but i warn you, you will lose a very curious sight
you will describe it to me
i
shall you go, then, albert?
let us go, then
on foot, yes, in a carriage, no.
i will go on foot, then.
is it important that you should go that way?
yes, there is something i wish to see.
excellency
ah! yes
well
what think you of the count of monte cristo?
what do i think?
that he has excellent cigars.
but
did you observe one very singular thing?
what?
how attentively he looked at you.
at me?
yes.
ah
i am now quite at your service, gentlemen
with all my heart
which are your windows?
the three last
as you left the choice of your costumes to me
i thought
i told you true
and yet here are two culprits.
if the pardon is to come, there is no time to lose.
and see, here it is
heaven be praised, and his holiness also
here is a pardon for one of the prisoners!
a pardon!
a pardon!
pardon for whom?
a pardon for peppino, called rocca priori
for peppino!
what is going on?
do you not see?
look, look
what are you doing?
well
what has, then, happened?
nothing
in fact
it is but a dream, a nightmare, that has disturbed you.
yes, that i have suffered; but the culprit?
but peppino—what has become of him?
well, albert
_ma foi_, no
gentlemen
ah, my dear fellow
you did not see?
what?
there,—that calash filled with roman peasants.
no.
well, i am convinced they are all charming women.
how unfortunate that you were masked, albert
oh
well
there is the beginning of an adventure.
_pardieu_
in token of your ingratitude.
bravo, bravo
no
on my word
a tailor
and for what?
to make us between now and tomorrow two roman peasant costumes
then i must give up the idea?
my dear albert
agreed
his excellency the count of monte cristo had
well
without being so far advanced as that, my dear countess
i cannot deny that we have abused his good nature all day.
all day?
you know him, then?
yes, and no.
how so?
it is a long story.
tell it to me.
it would frighten you too much.
so much the more reason.
at least wait until the story has a conclusion.
no; it was he who introduced himself to us.
when?
last night, after we left you.
through what medium?
the very prosaic one of our landlord.
he is staying, then, at the hôtel de londres with you?
not only in the same hotel, but on the same floor.
what is his name; for, of course, you know?
the count of monte cristo.
that is not a family name?
no, it is the name of the island he has purchased.
and he is a count?
a tuscan count.
well, we must put up with that
what sort of a man is he?
ask the vicomte de morcerf.
you hear, m. de morcerf, i am referred to you
we should be very hard to please, madam
come
her?
the beautiful greek of yesterday.
when you say invisible
where was this window with white hangings?
at the rospoli palace.
the count had three windows at the rospoli palace?
yes. did you pass through the corso?
yes.
two or three hundred roman crowns?
two or three thousand.
the deuce!
does his island produce him such a revenue?
it does not bring him a bajocco.
then why did he purchase it?
for a whim.
he is an original, then?
in reality
gentlemen
well
was i mistaken?
she has answered you!
read.
well
what do you think of that?
i think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable appearance.
i think so, also
take care, albert
whether she goes there or not, my opinion is still the same
you have read the letter?
yes.
yes.
you are born to good fortune
laugh as much as you will
i am in love.
you alarm me
if my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful
_moccoletti_!
then he has not returned?
i waited for him until this hour
and do you know whither he went?
_diavolo!_
i think, on the contrary, that it is a charming night
i am not speaking
ah
and don’t you know where he is?
not at all.
is he armed?
he is in masquerade.
you should not have allowed him to go
ah
your excellency
a letter from the viscount!
yes.
and who is the man?
i do not know.
why did he not bring it to me here?
the messenger did not say.
and where is the messenger?
he went away directly he saw me enter the ball-room to find you.
oh
i will hasten
shall we see you again to give us any information?
be prudent, in any event
oh! pray be assured of that.
what wants your excellency of me?
are not you the person who brought me a letter
your excellency lodges at pastrini’s hotel?
i do.
your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount?
i am.
your excellency’s name——
is the baron franz d’épinay.
then it is to your excellency that this letter is addressed.
is there any answer?
yes—your friend at least hopes so.
come upstairs with me, and i will give it to you.
i prefer waiting here
and why?
your excellency will know when you have read the letter.
shall i find you here, then?
certainly.
well?
well—what?
you have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend?
yes, i have seen him
p.s.—i now believe in italian _banditti_.
luigi vampa.
my dear sir
do you know if the count is within?
yes, your excellency; he has this moment returned.
is he in bed?
i should say no.
the count awaits your excellency.
well, what good wind blows you hither at this hour?
no; i have come to speak to you of a very serious matter.
a serious matter
and what may it be?
are we alone?
yes
read that
well, well!
did you see the postscript?
‘luigi vampa.’
what think you of that?
have you the money he demands?
yes, all but eight hundred piastres.
you see, on the contrary, i come to you first and instantly
and i thank you; have what you will;
is it absolutely necessary, then, to send the money to luigi vampa?
judge for yourself
the postscript is explicit.
how so?
what influence can i possibly have over a bandit?
have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten?
what is that?
have you not saved peppino’s life?
well, well
who told you that?
no matter; i know it.
and if i went to seek vampa, would you accompany me?
if my society would not be disagreeable.
shall i take any arms?
for what purpose?
any money?
it is useless. where is the man who brought the letter?
in the street.
he awaits the answer?
yes.
i must learn where we are going. i will summon him hither.
it is useless; he would not come up.
_salite!_
ah, it is you, peppino
ah
no, excellency; and never shall i forget it
oh, you may speak before his excellency
it is necessary to excite this man’s confidence.
you can speak before me
i am a friend of the count’s.
good!
how did the viscount albert fall into luigi’s hands?
the chief’s mistress?
what?
it was he who drove, disguised as the coachman
well?
what!
was a lad of fifteen
and beppo led him outside the walls?
well
why, that i should think it very amusing
and, in truth, if you had not found me here
and shall we go and find him?
i was never in them; but i have often resolved to visit them.
no.
that is of no consequence; i always have one ready, day and night.
always ready?
order out the carriage
half-past twelve
more determined than ever.
well, then, come along.
in ten minutes
we shall be there.
now
let us follow him.
ought we to go on?
or should we pause?
let us go on; peppino will have warned the sentry of our coming.
your excellency
go on, then
a friend!
would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose?
exceedingly
come with me, then. peppino, put out the torch.
who comes there?
well
ground arms
it seems that your memory is equally short in everything, vampa
what conditions have i forgotten, your excellency?
was it not agreed
and how have i broken that treaty, your excellency?
why did you not tell me all this—you?
well
are you not alone?
welcome among us, your excellency
but
nothing has happened to him, i hope
the prisoner is there
what is the prisoner doing?
_ma foi_, captain
come in, your excellency
come
you are right, your excellency
oh
half-past one only?
to tell you that you are free, your excellency.
my dear fellow
no, your excellency.
well, then, how am i free?
a person to whom i can refuse nothing has come to demand you.
come hither?
yes, hither.
really? then that person is a most amiable person.
what
no, not i
oh, my dear count
my dear albert
none, sir
you are as free as air.
well, then, a happy and merry life to you. come, gentlemen, come.
peppino
give me the torch.
what are you going to do?
i will show you the way back myself
and now, your excellency
no, my dear vampa
gentlemen
has your excellency anything to ask me?
yes, i have
cæsar’s _commentaries_
it is my favorite work.
well, are you coming?
yes
here i am
ah, your pardon
now, my dear count
madame
my dear count
my very good friend and excellent neighbor
upon my word
monsieur de morcerf
oh, pray name it.
i am wholly a stranger to paris—it is a city i have never yet seen.
is it possible
so distinguished an individual as yourself
oh, that i do, and with infinite pleasure
connected by marriage, you mean
well, never mind how it is
then it is settled
but tell me now, count
i pledge you my honor
when do you propose going thither?
have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself?
nay
and in three months’ time
you will be at my house?
shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour?
day for day, hour for hour
so be it, then
capital!
your breakfast shall be waiting.
where do you live?
no. 27, rue du helder.
quite sufficient
now then
shall i see you again ere my departure?
that depends; when do you leave?
tomorrow evening, at five o’clock.
yes.
for france?
no, for venice; i shall remain in italy for another year or two.
then we shall not meet in paris?
i fear i shall not have that honor.
well, since we must part
let us understand each other
what is the matter?
you seem more than commonly thoughtful.
i will confess to you, albert
my dear fellow
whether i am in my senses or not
listen to me, franz
possibly.
did you ever meet him previously to coming hither?
i have.
and where?
i promise.
upon your honor?
upon my honor.
then listen to me.
well
but
still
talking of countries
my dear franz
it was.
i confess he asked me none.
well
he is a philanthropist
27, _rue du helder, on the_ 21_st may, half-past ten_ a.m.
_sesame_
baby grand
how did these letters come?
one by the post, madame danglars’ footman left the other.
at what o’clock, sir, do you breakfast?
what time is it now?
a quarter to ten.
if you wish, i will inquire.
these papers become more and more stupid every day.
good-morning, lucien, good-morning
no, my dear fellow
ah, true; you drive don carlos out of spain.
at bourges?
yes; they sent me the order of charles iii.
and makes you resemble the prince of wales or the duke of reichstadt.
it is for that reason you see me so early.
it is my duty as your host
on my word
really, my dear albert
and what would you do, my dear diplomatist
how?
by introducing to you a new acquaintance.
a man or a woman?
a man.
i know so many men already.
but you do not know this man.
where does he come from—the end of the world?
farther still, perhaps.
the deuce! i hope he does not bring our breakfast with him.
oh, no; our breakfast comes from my father’s kitchen. are you hungry?
well, take another glass of sherry and another biscuit.
yes; but don carlos?
about what?
about the papers.
my dear friend
then you will dispute the more.
m. beauchamp
come in, come in
he is quite right
ah, you know that already
_pardieu!_
and what do they say of it in the world?
in which world? we have so many worlds in the year of grace 1838.
in the entire political world, of which you are one of the leaders.
come, come, that is not bad!
a gentleman, and a diplomatist.
be it so; i will stay; i must do something to distract my thoughts.
i understand; you must lay in a stock of hilarity.
do not run down m. danglars’ speeches
my dear friend
ah, this marriage will never take place
but two million francs make a nice little sum
never mind what he says, morcerf
on my word, i think you are right, lucien
do not say that, debray
he will sully it then
for i am low—very low.
oh, heavens
m. de château-renaud—m. maximilian morrel
now, then, to breakfast
morrel
morrel—who is he?
my dear albert
monsieur
well said
what has he done?
oh, nothing worth speaking of
not worth speaking of?
we gather from all this, baron, that captain morrel saved your life.
exactly so.
on what occasion?
beauchamp, my good fellow, you know i am starving
well, i do not prevent your sitting down to table
château-renaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast.
gentlemen
ah, true, a diplomatist!
well, since we are not to sit down to table
you all know that i had the fancy of going to africa.
it is a road your ancestors have traced for you
you are quite right, beauchamp
ah, true
you did fight some time ago; about what?
the devil take me, if i remember
that’s why you want to purchase my english horse
you are mistaken, for i have made a vow never to return to africa.
you were very much frightened, then?
well, yes, and i had good reason to be so
yes
heroic action
a strasbourg pie?
the horse?
no, the sacrifice
not for a stranger
but for a friend i might, perhaps.
i divined that you would become mine, count
the history to which m. morrel alludes
at half-past ten.
precisely?
oh, you will give me five minutes’ grace
of whom?
of myself
what shall we do?
we have only one monthyon prize.
well, it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve it
and where does he come from?
really
and you think him capable of being exact?
i think him capable of everything.
well, with the five minutes’ grace, we have only ten left.
i will profit by them to tell you something about my guest.
i beg pardon
yes, and for a most curious one.
i was at rome during the last carnival.
we know that
yes, but what you do not know is that i was carried off by bandits.
there are no bandits
come, my dear albert
i know it
and i did more than that
but franz did come with the four thousand crowns
no, he is a man about my own size.
armed to the teeth?
he had not even a knitting-needle.
but he paid your ransom?
he said two words to the chief and i was free.
and they apologized to him for having carried you off?
just so.
why, he is a second ariosto.
no, his name is the count of monte cristo.
there is no count of monte cristo
i do not think so
does anyone know anything of a count of monte cristo?
i think i can assist your researches
precisely!
he is rich, then?
i believe so.
but that ought to be visible.
that is what deceives you, debray.
i do not understand you.
have you read the _arabian nights_?
what a question!
which means?
and you have seen this cavern, morcerf?
and i also
ah
my dear albert
what you tell us is so extraordinary.
you say very true
yes
_pardieu!_ everyone exists.
have you seen the greek mistress?
he eats, then?
yes; but so little, it can hardly be called eating.
he must be a vampire.
ah, capital
wild eyes, the iris of which contracts or dilates at pleasure
just so, lucien
rail on, rail on at your ease, gentlemen
i am highly flattered
at the same time
there are no italian banditti
no vampire
no count of monte cristo
confess you have dreamed this, and let us sit down to breakfast
his excellency the count of monte cristo.
punctuality
my dear count
you wear the uniform of the new french conquerors, monsieur
it is a handsome uniform.
you have never seen our africans, count?
never
oh, m. de morcerf
let me go on, captain. and we have just heard
ah, you have a noble heart
so much the better.
why should he doubt it?
in reality
gentlemen
gentlemen
with what an air he says all this
a great man in his own country
a great man in every country, m. debray
my dear count
did you know me better
what
no
and you ate in your carriage?
but you can sleep when you please, monsieur?
yes.
you have a recipe for it?
an infallible one.
yes
may we inquire what is this recipe?
oh, yes
yes
he said something about it to me.
but
you always carry this drug about you?
always.
would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills?
no, monsieur
and is it your cook who prepares these pills?
oh, no, monsieur
this is a magnificent emerald, and the largest i have ever seen
although my mother has some remarkable family jewels.
i had three similar ones
the sultan, the liberty of a woman
and it was peppino you saved, was it not?
perhaps
ah
it was not i who made that promise
it seems to me
that is but fair
well
nothing more simple
with the condition that they should sin no more
i see they kept their promise.
no, monsieur
bravo
it is frank, at least
how have i deviated from those principles, monsieur?
why, it seems to me
of which he is the brightest ornament
my dear count
my dear vicomte
i will keep it
ah
the affair is still in projection.
and he who says in ‘projection,’ means already decided
no
eugénie danglars
yes
a baron of a new creation.
what matter
enormous ones
ah
i do not know him
thomson & french
do you know this house, monsieur?
they are my bankers in the capital of the christian world
i shall be at your orders
but
faubourg saint-germain
bah! château-renaud
boulevard de l’opéra
you have no idea, then, morrel?
oh, yes
you have a sister?
yes, monsieur, a most excellent sister.
married?
nearly nine years.
happy?
as happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be
i live there during my leave of absence
one minute
oh, no
thanks, monsieur
what
was i so badly lodged at rome?
it is not that which deterred me
but you have, then, a valet de chambre who knows paris?
it is ali!
yes, ali himself, my nubian mute, whom you saw, i think, at rome.
certainly
undeceive yourself, monsieur
ah, that is really original
and very princely
what, do you not know your house?
no
we must content ourselves, then
thanks, monsieur
is your steward also a nubian?
and you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward
of how much does he rob you every year?
on my word
then
i have something better than that
but you forget
who will tell her?
the first person who sees her.
she only speaks romaic.
that is different.
but at least we shall see her
oh, no
my dear albert
take care
and when you know, will you tell me?
i promise you. _au revoir_, albert. gentlemen, good morning.
my carriage.
bravo
for heaven’s sake, beauchamp
he is more than that
be sure i shall not fail to do so
my dear count
travels in the east
you have there a most charming mistress, viscount
ah, monsieur
now
azure seven merlets, or, placed bender
it is not indiscreet
yes
it is possible
father
you are most welcome, monsieur
the countess
it is a great honor to me
oh
these are the ideas that render your nation superior to any other
alas
but, monsieur
ah, father
that is the most just remark
you have been free to choose your career
precisely, monsieur
if i did not fear to fatigue you
ah, here is my mother
ah! good heavens, madame
are you ill, mother?
no
madame
madame
monsieur
we shall have the pleasure another time
i will not detain you, monsieur
my dear count
a thousand thanks for your kindness, viscount
monsieur
_ma foi_, spread that idea
and that will be worth something to me among the ladies.
my dear mother, have you been ill during my absence?
then, my dear mother
was i pale, albert?
did your father speak of it?
no, madame; but do you not remember that he spoke of the fact to you?
yes, i do remember
take these flowers into the anteroom or dressing-room
they make the countess ill.
what is this name of monte cristo?
his manners are admirable
what does he appear to be?
why, you have just said,—a man of high distinction.
i told you, my dear mother, he was esteemed such.
but what is your own opinion, albert?
i do not ask you of his origin but what he is.
you say——
that is possible
never mind
and what do you suppose is the count’s age?
thirty-five or thirty-six, mother.
so young,—it is impossible
and has this man displayed a friendship for you, albert?
i am inclined to think so.
and—do—you—like—him?
albert
you are right
nothing could be in better taste than my father’s demeanor, madame
this devil of a fellow
turnout
most decidedly
thanks, m. bertuccio
and the notary?
he is in the small salon, excellency
good; what o’clock is it?
four o’clock.
these are but indifferent marbles in this antechamber
i trust all this will soon be taken away.
yes, count
is the deed of sale ready?
yes, count.
have you brought it?
here it is.
very well; and where is this house that i purchase?
i do not know.
what!
no
the count does not know?
ah, that is different; the house you purchase is at auteuil.
and where is auteuil?
close by here, monsieur
so near as that?
i
ah, true
it is not yet too late
oh, no
and you are quite right
to be sure
it is very convenient, then?
it is more—it is magnificent.
_peste!_ let us not lose such an opportunity
the deed, if you please, mr. notary.
bertuccio
give fifty-five thousand francs to monsieur.
and now
are all the forms complied with?
all, sir.
have you the keys?
very well;
i have no further need of you; you may go.
but
and your fee?
is included in this sum.
but have you not come from auteuil here?
yes, certainly.
see this gentleman out
‘auteuil, rue de la fontaine, no. 28;’ it is indeed the same
bertuccio!
monsieur bertuccio
in some parts of france—yes, excellency.
you know the environs of paris, then?
no, excellency, no
it is unfortunate
to auteuil!
i have been almost obliged to wait.
his excellency’s horses!
your excellency’s carriage is at the door
well, take your hat and gloves
am i to accompany you, your excellency?
tell them to stop at rue de la fontaine, no. 28
well
knock
and announce me.
what is it?
it is your new master, my good fellow
the house is sold, then?
yes, my friend
oh, monsieur
what was the name of your old master?
the marquis of saint-méran!
an old gentleman
and is not this daughter dead?
thanks, thanks
give me a light.
shall i accompany you, monsieur?
no, it is unnecessary; bertuccio will show me a light.
ah, monsieur
i have not got any candles.
take one of the carriage-lamps, bertuccio
ah, here is a private staircase
monsieur
it leads to the garden.
and, pray, how do you know that?
it ought to do so, at least.
well, let us be sure of that.
go on, monsieur bertuccio
well!
no, no
no, monsieur, it is impossible; i can go no farther.
what does this mean?
why, you must see, your excellency
what, what!
no, no, monsieur
move, monsieur—move away, i entreat you; you are exactly in the spot!
what spot?
where he fell.
my dear monsieur bertuccio
monsieur, i implore you do not stay there!
i think you are going mad, bertuccio
alas! excellency
m. bertuccio
the abbé busoni, then told me an untruth
oh, do not do that, excellency; i have always served you faithfully
i do not deny it
but, your excellency
oh, your excellency!
yes, my good master
it was simply vengeance—nothing else.
but, monsieur, it is very natural
what! my house?
oh, your excellency, it was not yours, then.
oh, it was not on him, monsieur; it was on another.
this is strange
monsieur
then
oh, your excellency, your excellency!
that is different
what!
it was m. de villefort?
your excellency knows him?
the former royal attorney at nîmes?
yes.
who married the marquis of saint-méran’s daughter?
yes.
well, monsieur
well?
was a villain.
bah
impossible!
it is as i tell you.
ah, really
have you proof of this?
i had it.
and you have lost it; how stupid!
yes; but by careful search it might be recovered.
really
where you please
i thought the abbé busoni had told your excellency.
then i can speak without fear of tiring your excellency.
go on, m. bertuccio; you will supply the want of the evening papers.
the story begins in 1815.
ah
1815 is not yesterday.
but that is the history of the hundred days, m. bertuccio
unless i am mistaken, it has been already written.
go on; i will keep my word.
in the smuggling line?
eh, your excellency? everyone must live.
certainly; go on.
we are getting to the story now?
vaguely; i was far from france at that period. go on.
and this king’s attorney was named villefort?
then
you went to him?
well, well
and
did you ever know the name of this woman?
no, excellency
go on.
that evening
ah
no, your excellency
and was the sum a large one?
it was not money.
ah, i recollect
and what did you do with the child?
what letters were marked on the linen?
an h and an n, surmounted by a baron’s coronet.
in your service, excellency, where everything is learned.
go on, i am curious to know two things.
what are they, your excellency?
no excellency, i do not recollect telling you that.
i thought you did; i must have been mistaken.
the story will be very long, excellency.
philosophy, m. bertuccio
oh, excellency!
this
alas, your excellency is right
sweet child
oh, had he been my own son
yes
precisely
what was his name?
and you say
1829, your excellency.
in what month?
june.
the beginning or the end?
the evening of the 3rd.
ah
the evening of the 3rd of june, 1829. go on.
and what did you think of this fine story, eavesdropper?
did you credit it?
go on.
and then it was, i presume
no
i, your excellency?
and in what light did you view the occurrence?
as a punishment for the crime i had committed
oh, those villeforts are an accursed race!
truly they are
and now
everything is possible
even
do not think so, bertuccio
so be it
i understand
madame will be tired tonight
pray, does not the count of monte cristo live here?
his excellency does reside here
but——
but what?
his excellency does not receive visitors today.
i never speak to his excellency
well?
bless me
that fellow has a decidedly bad countenance
summon bertuccio
did your excellency desire to see me?
i did
then how comes it
it is not your fault, my good ali
permit me to assure your excellency
it seems, sir steward
is your excellency really in earnest?
i have to pay a visit this evening
at five o’clock
i beg your excellency’s pardon
i am perfectly aware of that fact
monsieur baptistin
it only remains for me to know whether i also suit you?
oh, your excellency!
listen, if you please, till i have finished speaking
nay, indeed, your excellency.
i forgot to mention to you
i assure your excellency
by no means
you seem incredulous
my horses
no, the coachman, ali, and baptistin will go.
does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful
to the residence of baron danglars, rue de la chaussée d’antin.
i have another commission for you, m. bertuccio
and the yacht.
was ordered to remain at martigues.
and the steamboat?
she is at châlons?
yes.
the same orders for her as for the two sailing vessels.
very good.
your excellency may depend upon me.
i have the honor, i presume, of addressing m. de monte cristo.
so much so
upon my word, monsieur
why
permit me to inform you, count
yes
indeed?
why
in the letter—i believe i have it about me
well, baron, what is there difficult to understand about that?
merely the term _unlimited_—nothing else, certainly.
is it possible?
thomson & french are perfectly solvent
is, in fact, unlimited
precisely what i was about to say
meaning to say
not at all.
monsieur
the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned.
it seems, then, reserved for me
by what right, sir?
well, sir
why, truly
i beg your pardon
i said a million
but could i do with a million?
come, come
oh, sir
nay
whatever you say, my dear count; i am at your orders.
why
oh, my dear count
six millions!
so be it.
then, if i should require more
half in gold, and the other half in bank-notes, if you please
i must confess to you, count
it has been in the family a very long while
with your tastes, and means of gratifying them
is the baroness at home?
yes, my lord
and alone?
no, my lord, madame has visitors.
no, indeed
and who is with madame?—m. debray?
yes, my lord
m. debray is with madame.
ah, indeed?
and where was that?
at the house of m. de morcerf.
ah! you are acquainted with the young viscount, are you?
we were together a good deal during the carnival at rome.
true, true
her ladyship is waiting to receive you, gentlemen
with your permission
by all means
i follow you.
baroness
and when did you arrive here?
yesterday morning, madame.
nay, madame. this time i have merely come from cadiz.
are you fond of horses, count?
nay, count
i cannot believe it; the thing is impossible.
i assure you, madame
it is as i have said.
is what true, madame?
what my maid tells me.
but what does she tell you?
be kind enough, madame, to listen to me
madame
nonsense
why, yes
i am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me
i could not tell you before others
great heavens?
what is it?
my dappled grays?
’tis indeed they!
how very singular
i cannot believe it
the baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horses.
i scarcely know
see
excellent
dappled grays
ali
i thought i did not mistake. with your lasso you could stop an ox?
or a tiger?
a lion even?
i understand
it is well
compose yourself, madame
all danger is over.
i understand the nature of your alarms, madame
where am i?
madame
my wretched curiosity has brought all this about
is it possible
that these horses belong to the baroness?
you have rightly guessed, madame
and i am madame héloïse de villefort.
indeed, i still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed in.
i beseech you, madame
nay
touch nothing, my little friend
he’s too ugly.
this lady
will you permit me to inquire
whether you usually reside here?
no, i do not
i dare not return with those dreadful horses
you will see
dappled grays
know thyself
the noble stranger
sir
eye severe
monsieur
yes, sir
ah, you philosophize
why, in truth, sir
sir
if this law were adopted, sir
it may, perhaps, come to this in time
in the meanwhile
but with what motive have you learned all this?
really, sir
pray, sir, explain yourself
i really do—not—understand you—perfectly.
then
and why not?
your pardon, sir
really, sir
sir
then we do not see those beings to whom you allude?
ah
then you yourself are one of these marked beings?
i know it sir
that is to say
faults or crimes
you alone are perfect.
no, not perfect
no, no,—by no means
above us all, sir
then, count, i admire you
i have, sir.
and what may it be?
count
have you any relations?
no, sir, i am alone in the world.
so much the worse.
why?
and old age?
my end will be achieved before i grow old.
and madness?
sir
alas, sir
and what is your deduction from this compensation, sir?
my deduction is
adieu, sir
enough of this poison, let me now seek the antidote.
haydée
you well know.
why do you address me so coldly—so distantly?
haydée
free to do what?
free to leave me.
leave you? why should i leave you?
i don’t wish to see anybody but you.
my poor child
do you remember your father, haydée?
he is here, and here
and where am i?
you?
you now understand, haydée
speak.
i have already told you, my lord, that i shall see no one.
my child
my lord
shall i see you?
every day.
then what do you fear, my lord?
you might find it dull.
the count of monte cristo?
come, come
don’t disturb yourself, julie
ah, monsieur
i think you hailed me, mademoiselle julie?
mademoiselle julie
penelon
i am sorry to see
look there
your family appears to be a very happy one
five-and-twenty thousand francs is not a large sum, however
and this is the reason, monsieur
madame
we are very happy, monsieur
yes, count
our magnificence makes you smile, count
no, no
count
the stone seems very brilliant
ah, really
monsieur
sinbad the sailor.
yes; we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand
oh
an englishman
an englishman you say?
yes
yes.
everything is possible in this affair, even a miracle.
what was his name?
he gave no other name
than that at the end of his letter—‘sinbad the sailor.’
which is evidently not his real name, but a fictitious one.
tell me
oh, do you then know him?
no
without revealing himself?
oh, heaven
he did not credit it at the period which i knew him
and do you know this gentleman, monsieur?
oh, if you do know him
in the name of heaven
alas
oh, monsieur, this is cruel of you
madame
but
oh, it is useless to inquire
and he told you nothing?
not a word.
nothing that would lead you to suppose?
nothing.
and yet you spoke of him at once.
ah, in such a case one supposes——
sister, sister
what did your father tell you, m. morrel?
madame
this count of monte cristo is a strange man
yes
his voice went to my heart
man proposes
don’t be alarmed, valentine—it is i!
dearest valentine
what excessive nonsense you talk, maximilian!
i will not admit that word
it is true
valentine
dearest, dearest valentine
no, maximilian, i am not offended
hate you, sweet valentine
alas
but why should it?
poor valentine!
because i judge it from the past.
i fear, valentine
now it is you who are unjust, maximilian
and what is that?
not that i am aware of
i will tell you
dear valentine!
indeed
oh, such a dreadful thing, that i don’t dare to tell you.
always tell me everything
brutal politics, i must confess.
the name of m. noirtier
how singular
hush
someone is coming!
mademoiselle, mademoiselle!
a visitor?
who is it?
i will come directly
i am coming
now, then
my husband dines with the chancellor
what is your sister valentine doing?
you have a daughter, then, madame?
the daughter of m. de villefort by his first marriage
a fine well-grown girl.
but melancholy
be still, edward!
because they are looking for her where she is not to be found.
and where are they looking for her?
with grandpapa noirtier.
and do you think she is not there?
no, no, no, no, no, she is not there
and where is she, then? if you know, why don’t you tell?
she is under the big chestnut-tree
mademoiselle de villefort, my step-daughter
and m. de monte cristo, king of china, emperor of cochin-china
but, madame
no, indeed
perhaps the count saw us in italy
yes, in italy; it was in italy most probably
you have travelled then in italy, mademoiselle?
ah, yes—true, mademoiselle
it is strange, but neither do i recollect meeting with you
but i remember it perfectly
i will assist your memory, madame
and i caught it, mamma, don’t you remember?
yes, in truth, yes
yes, true
yes, really, sir, you were in fact a medical man
since you had cured the sick.
it is six o’clock
oh, madame
by no means
yes, madame, m. de villefort spoke of it to me—a paralysis, i think.
no, madame, i did not say as much as that
_mithridates, rex ponticus_
edward, you naughty boy
the album
what do you mean?—the album!
i want the album.
how dare you tear out the drawings?
oh, it amuses me.
go—go at once.
i won’t go unless you give me the album
take it, then, and pray disturb us no longer
let us see if she shuts the door after him
allow me to observe, madame
oh, sometimes severity is quite necessary
the fact is, count
and your precautions were successful?
completely so.
indeed?
i really did not remember.
and that is the case
brucine is extracted from the false angostura8 is it not?
precisely, madame
oh, i am aware of that
well
do you know any other counter-poisons?
i do not.
i have often read, and read again, the history of mithridates
and the more, madame
really
oh, yes, indeed, madame
but, sir
what would you have, sir?
now
then
it is quite frightful, but deeply interesting
so
were objects of art, madame, and nothing more
really?
but
but
precisely so
it is very fortunate
by chemists and persons who have a taste for chemistry
and then
yet conscience remains
yes
do you know, my dear count
is it then so terrible a poison?
what, then, is it?
oh
perfect, madame, as you have seen
most assuredly
they are indeed exquisite
but i
how kind you are.
a thousand thanks, madame
adieu, then, sir, and do not forget the prescription.
he is a very strange man
good
surely
that must be the countess g——.
and who is the countess g——?
ah, to be sure
herself.
you know her, it seems?
franz introduced me to her at rome
with pleasure.
shut up!
the countess was present at the races in the champ-de-mars
today?
yes.
bless me, i quite forgot the races. did you bet?
oh, merely a paltry fifty louis.
and who was the winner?
nautilus. i staked on him.
but there were three races, were there not?
what was it?
oh, shut up!
why, it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course.
is that possible?
no.
you say that the horse was entered under the name of vampa?
exactly; that was the title.
then
shut up, there!
ha, ha
i tell you what, my dear fellow
handsome, certainly
ah, well
so we meet again, my travelling friend, do we?
be assured
so you were at the races, baron?
yes, madame.
well, then
i am sorry to say i cannot
are you very anxious to know, countess?
to know what?
the name of the owner of the winning horse?
precisely; i was sure of it
sure of what?
that the owner of the horse was lord ruthven himself.
what lord ruthven do you mean?
why, our lord ruthven—the vampire of the salle argentina!
is it possible?
is he here in paris?
to be sure,—why not?
and you visit him?—meet him at your own house and elsewhere?
was not the winning horse entered by the name of vampa?
what of that?
oh, yes.
to be sure, i remember it all now.
but what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me?
oh, but that is dreadful! why, the man must owe me a fearful grudge.
does his action appear like that of an enemy?
no; certainly not.
well, then——
and so he is in paris?
yes.
and what effect does he produce?
why
my good fellow
perhaps you are right
which box do you mean?
did you observe anyone during the first act?
where?
in that box.
no
i am sure of it.
and who afterwards sent the cup to me?
undoubtedly.
but i don’t know him
shall i see you again?
pray take notice
hullo
it is monte cristo and his greek!
my dear fellow
is it not almost incredible
let me assure you, madame
he seems to have a mania for diamonds
perhaps he has discovered some mine
i was not aware of it
he must be the shah of persia, travelling _incog_.
have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman, m. lucien?
a most lovely creature, upon my soul!
who is this young person, m. de morcerf?
mademoiselle
i am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a _cicerone_
then your count entertains visitors, does he?
indeed he does, and in a most lavish manner, i can assure you.
what
why not? my husband could accompany me.
but do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor?
you have ample proof to the contrary, if you look opposite
no, no!
well, then
of the ‘arabian nights’.
to me she seems overloaded
see how the artist peeps out!
i admire all that is beautiful
what do you think of the count?
the count
the count?—oh, he is so dreadfully pale.
i quite agree with you
then the countess g—— has returned to paris, has she?
is that she, mamma?
yes
command me, madame.
well, then, you should go and bring your count of monte cristo to us.
what for?
none whatever
strange child
he will very probably come of his own accord
well
go straight to his box; that will be the simplest plan.
but i have never been presented.
presented to whom?
to the beautiful greek.
you say she is only a slave?
that is possible—go.
i am going
upon my word
really? and what has procured me so flattering a distinction?
and who has filled your head with all this nonsense?
that was an oversight, certainly
he will be here tonight.
in what part of the house?
in the baroness’s box, i believe.
that charming young woman with her is her daughter?
yes.
i congratulate you.
we will discuss that subject at length some future time
but what do you think of the music?
what music?
why, the music you have been listening to.
i know—the famous hashish!
i have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you
do you mean at rome?
i do.
you will excuse my leaving you
what? are you going?
and what message shall i convey to the baroness!
you are welcome, count!
was it ali
no, count
oh, you are no stranger—at least not by name
this is the count of monte cristo.
you have a charming young person with you tonight, count
is she your daughter?
no, mademoiselle
and what is her name?
haydée
a greek?
yes, indeed, count
did i hear rightly, monsieur
i was inspector-general of the pasha’s troops
but look!
where?
there
why, count
very probably
who was it you were talking with over there?
with the count of morcerf
wretch!
something of this i heard in epirus
do you observe
you are in constant communication with the baron danglars?
yes, count, you know what i told you?
all remains the same, then, in that quarter?
it is more than ever a settled thing
ah
yes
very pretty, or rather, very beautiful
you speak as if you were already her husband.
ah
really
mademoiselle danglars is too rich for me
bah
there is still something else
i confess
oh
ah
i do not know if that is her reason
real?
marry her then
yes
then do not marry her
ah
oh, no
in arithmetic?
that is not his biggest scoop
my dear fellow
but you were speaking of haitians?
and what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206?
because
ah
it is not he who plays!
how can i, if her husband fails in controlling her?
ah, if i were in your place——
well?
how would you set about it?
ah, that would be easy enough—i would give her a lesson.
a lesson?
i do not understand
it is very clear, notwithstanding
willingly, count; i accept.
do you not think, on reflection
my dear count
then
indeed, count
do you think so?
well
i will do better than that
saturday.
when shall you send your invitations?
this very day.
ah, true.
what must i do to attain such sublimity?
a thousand thanks
i am going to give you a proof
humph
oh, you do not mean that
i had no previous knowledge of your visit, had i?
at all events, i could not guess that you would invite me to dinner.
probably not.
to close the door against visitors as soon as the clock struck five
what then?
ah, my dear count
then to admit no one except major bartolomeo cavalcanti and his son.
certainly; i see you are a model mentor
have you? is he still amusing himself in italy?
his opinion of me is altered for the better, then?
he is a charming young man
he is.
the same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815?
by the bonapartists.
yes, he is to marry mademoiselle de villefort.
indeed?
and you know i am to marry mademoiselle danglars
you smile.
yes.
why do you do so?
are you going?
by all means.
ah, ha; you will do as much as that, will you?
yes.
well, really, nothing is certain in this world.
nothing is impossible
really, my dear m. bertuccio
ah, my dear sir, you are most welcome; i was expecting you.
indeed
yes; i had been told that i should see you today at seven o’clock.
then you have received full information concerning my arrival?
of course.
what precaution?
that of informing you beforehand of my coming.
oh, no, it has not.
but you are sure you are not mistaken.
very sure.
i will prove it to you beyond a doubt.
oh, no, never mind that
yes, yes
let me see
bartolomeo cavalcanti
ex-major in the austrian service?
was i a major?
yes
very good
i do not demand more, you understand——
your visit here today is not of your own suggestion, is it?
no, certainly not.
you were sent by some other person?
yes.
by the excellent abbé busoni?
exactly so
and you have a letter?
yes, there it is.
give it to me, then.
‘possessing an income of half a million.’
half a million
magnificent!
half a million, is it?
you have opened my eyes
‘and who only needs one thing more to make him happy.’
yes, indeed but one!
‘which is to recover a lost and adored son.’
a lost and adored son!
at the age of five years!
unhappy father
i have the power of so doing
so, then
the letter was true to the end?
did you doubt it, my dear monsieur bartolomeo?
ah, true
there is a postscript.
yes, yes
yes—there—is—a—postscript.
very good
he said ‘very good,’
then—sir——
then what?
then the postscript——
well; what of the postscript?
i must explain to you
why, really i know no one
but then you yourself are known to others?
yes, i am known, so that——
proceed, my dear monsieur cavalcanti.
so that you will remit to me these 48,000 francs?
certainly, at your first request.
but sit down
don’t mention it.
now
alicante, if you please; it is my favorite wine.
yes, i will take a biscuit, as you are so obliging.
well?
the young man is here
into what room did you take him?
into the blue drawing-room, according to your excellency’s orders.
that’s right; now bring the alicante and some biscuits.
really
pray don’t mention such a thing
all
only one thing
and that one thing, your lost child.
ah
let me hear, then
that was the general opinion, sir
and i——
yes
yes
not on your own account, surely
oh, no, certainly not on my own account
but for the sake of the mother?
yes, for the mother’s sake—his poor mother!
take some more wine, my dear cavalcanti
his poor mother
she was of a noble family of fiesole, count.
and her name was——
do you desire to know her name——?
oh
the count knows everything
oliva corsinari, was it not?
oliva corsinari!
a marchioness?
a marchioness!
yes, that was the way it ended.
and you have doubtless brought all your papers with you?
what papers?
the register of my child’s birth?
i believe so
what? you believe so?
well, then
you have all the documents with you?
that is unfortunate
were they, then, so necessary?
they were indispensable.
true
there might be doubts raised.
in that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated.
it would be fatal to his interests.
it might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance.
_o peccato!_
that is the misfortune! you see i have not these necessary papers.
fortunately, i have them, though
you?
yes.
you have them?
i have them.
ah, indeed?
he is an excellent person.
he is extremely prudent and thoughtful.
he is an admirable man
and he sent them to you?
here they are.
yes indeed, there it is truly
all quite correct.
i should think so, indeed! if he were to lose them——
well, and if he were to lose them?
in that case
it would be a difficult matter to arrange
almost an impossibility
i am very glad to see that you understand the value of these papers.
i regard them as invaluable.
now
as to the mother of the young man——
as to the mother of the young man——
as regards the marchesa corsinari——
really
no, sir
besides, has she not——
yes, sir
she has——
paid the last debt of nature?
alas, yes
i knew that
she has been dead these ten years.
and i am still mourning her loss
what would you have?
you think so?
certainly.
very well, then.
if they should hear of the separation——
ah, yes; what could i say?
that an unfaithful tutor, bought over by the enemies of your family——
by the corsinari?
that is reasonable, since he is an only son.
an agreeable one?
hum!
that who was here?
your child—your son—your andrea!
i did guess it
then he is here?
he is
ah, very well, very well
my dear sir
i should quite imagine that to be the case
well, in a quarter of an hour he shall be with you.
by the way
it is 40,000 francs which i now owe you
does your excellency wish for a receipt?
for what?
i thought you might want it to show the abbé busoni.
yes, so it is, between perfectly upright people.
one word more
say on.
you will permit me to make one remark?
certainly; pray do so.
then i should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress.
indeed
that’s unfortunate.
but what shall i wear?
what you find in your trunks.
in my trunks? i have but one portmanteau.
that is just the case—precisely so.
then, in these trunks——
very well, very well
now
the count of monte cristo, i believe?
count andrea cavalcanti
the letter signed ‘sinbad the sailor,’ is it not?
ah, indeed? then that explains everything that is extraordinary
if what you say be true
certainly, i will do so
really, all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting
most undoubtedly
yes
a carriage was to await you at nice?
but
oh, the voice of nature
true
now
sir!
sir
besides
well
i agree with you, monsieur
such consequences would be extremely unpleasant.
nevertheless, you must not exaggerate the evil
i would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser
however, your excellency
yes, certainly
he is a millionaire—his income is 500,000 francs.
then
then in that case i shall always choose to remain there.
but
you may.
shall i receive it from my father?
and does my father mean to remain long in paris?
only a few days
ah, my dear father!
therefore
i hope you do not doubt it.
ah, my dear father!
is it really you?
how do you do, my dear son?
after so many years of painful separation
indeed it is, after so long a separation.
will you not embrace me, sir?
if you wish it, my son
then we are once more reunited?
once more
never more to be separated?
the fact is
where are these papers, then?
here they are.
why?—what do you mean by that question?
will you be good enough to explain your meaning?
my dear m. cavalcanti
how much are you paid for being my father?
make yourself easy, we are quite alone
well, then
they paid me 50,000 francs down.
monsieur cavalcanti
do you believe in fairy tales?
most palpable proofs
as you may perceive.
you think, then, that i may rely on the count’s promises?
certainly i do.
you are sure he will keep his word with me?
whom do you mean by they?
yes.
from whom?
from a certain abbé busoni.
have you any knowledge of him?
no, i have never seen him.
what did he say in the letter?
you will promise not to betray me?
rest assured of that; you well know that our interests are the same.
then read for yourself;
(signed) ‘abbé busoni.’
it is the same.
what do you mean?
you?
yes.
from the abbé busoni?
no.
from whom, then?
and of whom you have no more knowledge than i of the abbé busoni?
you are mistaken; there i am ahead of you.
you have seen him, then?
yes, once.
where?
and what did the letter contain?
read it.
_parbleu!_
‘sinbad the sailor.’
humph
very good. you have seen the count, you say?
i have only just left him.
and has he conformed to all that the letter specified?
he has.
do you understand it?
not in the least.
there is a dupe somewhere.
at all events, it is neither you nor i.
certainly not.
well, then——
why, it does not much concern us, do you think it does?
i never once doubted your doing so.
well, marquis
ah, your excellency, i am overwhelmed with delight.
and what are your feelings?
as for me, my heart is overflowing with happiness.
happy father, happy son!
there is only one thing which grieves me
i am at your service, sir
now, sir
to whom?
tell m. cavalcanti something of the state of your finances.
_ma foi!_ monsieur, you have touched upon a tender chord.
do you hear what he says, major?
certainly i do.
but do you understand?
i do.
your son says he requires money.
well, what would you have me do?
you should furnish him with some of course
i?
yes, you
what is this?
it is from your father.
from my father?
am i to consider this as part of my income on account?
no, it is for the first expenses of your settling in paris.
ah, how good my dear father is!
silence
i fully appreciate his delicacy
and now, gentlemen, i wish you good-morning
ah
when may we hope for that pleasure?
full dress?
oh, yes, certainly
uniform, cross, knee-breeches.
and how shall i be dressed?
at what hour shall we come?
about half-past six.
we will be with you at that time
there go two miscreants;
have patience! you see it is not my fault.
good-evening, valentine
who told you we were intimate, maximilian?
we were having a confidential conversation
dear valentine!
it is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light.
i told you i was not on terms of strict intimacy with eugénie.
come, what did she say?
she told me that she loved no one
ah, you see——
well, what does that prove?
nothing
then why did you smile?
do you want me to go away?
_ma foi!_
but why must you leave me so soon?
i do not think that is the case.
do you think to reassure me when you say that, maximilian?
well?
monsieur franz is his friend, you know.
what then?
why not?
is it so? then i feel as if i could adore madame de villefort.
do not be in such a hurry to do that
yes.
extraordinary, did you say?
yes.
you have known him for some time, then?
scarcely longer than eight or ten days.
he must be a prophet, then
indeed
ah
my poor girl, you know him already.
i know him?
yes; it was he who saved the life of your step-mother and her son.
the count of monte cristo?
the same.
ah
me?
ah, valentine, i assure you you are mistaken.
well, valentine
alas!
my good friend
i see that you are right, logically speaking
i feel the same as regards yourself.
i have another
so much the worse
yes, since you have known me
ah! what a beautiful creature!
he is, as you see, a very valuable animal
ah, valentine
as you will, valentine.
shall you be happy if i do what you wish?
oh, yes!
this communication
sir
we are thinking of marrying valentine.
sir
this marriage
that assassination was a mysterious affair
now
yes, i understand
now sir
dear grandpapa
who has displeased you? is it my father?
no.
madame de villefort?
no.
me?
are you displeased with me?
yes
yes.
no, no
ah, you frighten me. what can they have said?
ah, i know
they have been speaking of my marriage,—have they not?
yes
it is not only your reserve which afflicts me.
what is it, then?
no.
yes.
then why are you still vexed and grieved?
yes, i understand
it is because you love me.
and you are afraid i shall be unhappy?
yes.
you do not like m. franz?
then you are vexed with the engagement?
yes.
well, listen
well
you are mistaken; i can still do much for you.
do you think you can help me, dear grandpapa?
yes.
what is it you want, dear grandpapa?
no
ah
yes, yes, yes
ah, it is no, then?
yes.
notary
do you want a notary, dear grandpapa?
you would wish a notary to be sent for then?
yes.
shall my father be informed of your wish?
yes.
do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately?
yes.
yes.
are you satisfied now?
yes.
i am sure you are; it is not very difficult to discover that.
what do you want me for, sir?
sir
my grandfather wishes for a notary.
yes
do you wish for a notary?
yes.
what to do?
what do you want with a notary?
is it to do us some ill turn? do you think it is worth while?
still
yes, i do want a notary
you shall have a notary, as you absolutely wish for one, sir
never mind that
sir
sir
that is quite true
permit me
sir
yes.
it was you who sent for me?
yes.
to make your will?
yes.
well, sir
sir
it is not exactly that, sir
you must see that to be an utter impossibility
sir
no
let us try what we can do, then
yes.
it is very evident that it is the letter w which m. noirtier wants
wait
wa—we—wi——
will
will
yes, yes, yes
really, sir, you must allow that this is most extraordinary
yes
no, no, no
what?
no.
sir
yes
what is he going to do?
yes.
have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune?
yes.
yes.
your fortune exceeds 300,000 francs, does it not?
do you possess 400,000 francs?
500,000?
600,000—700,000—800,000—900,000?
you are then in possession of 900,000 francs?
yes.
in landed property?
no.
in stock?
yes.
the stock is in your own hands?
do you permit us to open this casket?
yes.
to whom do you desire to leave this fortune?
oh!
what
no.
you are not making any mistake, are you?
no
no.
ah, yes, most assuredly
thank you, thank you
no?
no.
what have we all done, then, dear grandpapa?
well
my hand?
yes.
her hand!
ah
yes, yes, yes
you are angry with us all on account of this marriage, are you not?
yes?
really, this is too absurd
excuse me, sir
you do not wish me to marry m. franz d’épinay?
i do not wish it
and you disinherit your granddaughter
yes.
so that, but for this marriage, she would have been your heir?
yes.
but
sir
you will, of course, dispose of it in some way or other?
yes.
in favor of some member of your family?
no.
do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes, then?
yes.
but
yes.
do you still wish to dispose of all?
yes.
but they will contest the will after your death?
no.
my father knows me
what do you decide on, sir?
_ma foi!_
no, count
to what do you refer?
have you really met with some great misfortune?
oh, no, monsieur
true
it is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me
what do you say?
my father, as i told you.
but to do this he must have spoken?
he has done better than that—he has made himself understood.
how was such a thing possible?
my dear
perhaps you exaggerate the evil.
good-morning, madame
what is this that m. de villefort has been telling me?
and what incomprehensible misfortune——
incomprehensible is the word!
it is an old man’s caprice!
and is there no means of making him revoke his decision?
yes
my dear
do you think
madame
never mind
notwithstanding your father’s wishes to the contrary?
that is a serious thing.
madame
what?
yes, sir, that is the reason
the apparent reason, at least
the _real_ reason, madame, i can assure you; i know my father.
i believe i know m. franz d’épinay
the same
well, but he is a charming young man, according to my ideas.
but
do you not know any cause for this hatred?
ah, _ma foi!_ who is to know?
perhaps it is some political difference?
was not your father a bonapartist?
my father has been a jacobin more than anything else
well
am i mistaken, then?
no, sir, the facts were precisely what you have stated
it was a sublime and charitable thought
although
and who are fully as well worth loving and tending as m. noirtier
but it seems to me
true
count
however
ah, that would be a great pity
a great pity
undoubtedly
i agree with m. de villefort
sir
are you going to leave us, count?
did you fear that we should forget it?
my husband has given me his word, sir
and
no
in the country?
yes.
where is it, then? near paris, is it not?
very near, only half a league from the barriers,—it is at auteuil.
at auteuil?
rue de la fontaine.
rue de la fontaine!
no. 28.
then
did it belong to m. de saint-méran?
yes
believe what?
you think this house pretty, do you not?
i think it charming.
well, my husband would never live in it.
indeed?
i do not like auteuil, sir
no, count,—i hope—i assure you i shall do my best
oh
i will come, count,—i will be sure to come
thank you
you said before that you were obliged to leave us, monsieur
indeed madame
nonsense; say on.
what is it?
a telegraph. so now i have told my secret.
a telegraph?
and are you going there?
i am.
you are a singular man
what line would you advise me to study?
the one that is most in use just at this time.
the spanish one, you mean, i suppose?
no
_ma foi!_ you frighten me. which is the nearest way? bayonne?
yes; the road to bayonne.
and afterwards the road to châtillon?
yes.
by the tower of montlhéry, you mean?
yes.
the man at the telegraph
you are gathering your crop, sir?
excuse me, sir
do not let me interfere with you in anything, my friend
gather your strawberries, if, indeed, there are any left.
i have ten left
certainly, it is wrong
of course
calm yourself, my friend
ah, my time is not valuable
indeed, i should think not
what? did the romans eat them?
ate dormice?
i have read so in petronius
you ate it?
did you come here, sir, to see the telegraph?
yes, if it isn’t contrary to the rules.
oh, no
i have been told
that is true, sir, and that is what i like best
why do you like that best?
is it possible
sir
i follow you.
does it require much study to learn the art of telegraphing?
and what is the pay?
a thousand francs, sir.
it is nothing.
no; but then we are lodged, as you perceive.
it is very interesting
but it must be very tedious for a lifetime.
holidays?
yes.
when?
when we have a fog.
ah, to be sure.
how long have you been here?
ten years, and five as a supernumerary make fifteen.
you are——
fifty-five years old.
how long must you have served to claim the pension?
oh, sir, twenty-five years.
and how much is the pension?
a hundred crowns.
poor humanity!
what did you say, sir?
i was saying it was very interesting.
what was?
none at all.
and have you never tried to understand them?
never. why should i?
but still there are some signals only addressed to you.
certainly.
and do you understand them?
they are always the same.
and they mean——
‘_nothing new; you have an hour;_’ or ‘_tomorrow_.’
this is simple enough
ah, yes; thank you, sir.
and what is it saying—anything you understand?
yes; it asks if i am ready.
and you reply?
it is very ingenious
you will see
in five minutes he will speak.
i have, then, five minutes
what is it, sir?
you are fond of gardening?
passionately.
sir, i should make a terrestrial paradise of it.
you live badly on your thousand francs?
badly enough; but yet i do live.
yes; but you have a wretchedly small garden.
true, the garden is not large.
ah, they are my scourges.
i should not see him.
then what would happen?
i could not repeat the signals.
and then?
not having repeated them, through negligence, i should be fined.
how much?
a hundred francs.
the tenth of your income—that would be fine work.
ah!
has it ever happened to you?
once, sir, when i was grafting a rose-tree.
well, suppose you were to alter a signal, and substitute another?
three hundred francs?
not even for fifteen years’ wages? come, it is worth thinking about?
for fifteen thousand francs?
yes.
sir, you alarm me.
nonsense.
sir, you are tempting me?
just so; fifteen thousand francs, do you understand?
sir, let me see my right-hand correspondent.
on the contrary, do not look at him, but at this.
what is it?
what? do you not know these bits of paper?
bank-notes!
exactly; there are fifteen of them.
and whose are they?
yours, if you like.
mine?
yes; yours—your own property.
sir, my right-hand correspondent is signalling.
let him signal.
sir, you have distracted me; i shall be fined.
never mind—take these;
now this is not all
i shall still have my place.
oh, sir, what are you proposing?
a jest.
sir, unless you force me——
i think i can effectually force you;
here are ten thousand more francs
a garden with two acres of land!
and a thousand francs a year.
oh, heavens!
come, take them
what am i to do?
nothing very difficult.
but what is it?
to repeat these signs.
there, you see it will not take long.
yes; but——
do this, and you will have nectarines and all the rest.
now you are rich
yes
but at what a price!
listen, friend
has your husband any spanish bonds?
i think so, indeed! he has six millions’ worth.
he must sell them at whatever price.
why?
because don carlos has fled from bourges, and has returned to spain.
how do you know?
the idea of asking how i hear the news
good
what have you discovered?
that can only be to hold gloves
will your excellency deign to open it?
and you will find gloves in it.
good
i am sure i am the first
do not alarm yourself, my dear maximilian—they understand.
i should think so,—a horse that cost 5,000 francs!
do you regret them?
i? certainly not
then they follow you?
see, they are here.
ah, madame
why did you not make that request of me?
with you, sir
unfortunately
how so?
you see my position, madame
it seems to me
that you have already got horses enough.
why
ah! madame
how so?—at what period can that have been?
sir
stay
i recognize this hobbema.
ah, indeed!
yes; it was proposed for the museum.
which, i believe, does not contain one?
no; and yet they refused to buy it.
why?
you pretend not to know,—because government was not rich enough.
ah, pardon me
you will, by and by
i think not
major bartolomeo cavalcanti and count andrea cavalcanti
cavalcanti!
a fine name
yes
you are fastidious, château-renaud
who are those gentlemen?
you heard—cavalcanti.
that tells me their name, and nothing else.
have they any fortune?
an enormous one.
what do they do?
but they appear to speak french with a very pure accent
upon what subject?
a fine idea that of his
the baron appears thoughtful today
m. and madame de villefort
certainly, women alone know how to dissimulate
what do you want, m. bertuccio?
your excellency has not stated the number of guests.
ah, true.
how many covers?
count for yourself.
is everyone here, your excellency?
yes.
good heavens!
what is the matter?
that woman—that woman!
which?
the one with a white dress and so many diamonds—the fair one.
madame danglars?
i do not know her name; but it is she, sir, it is she!
whom do you mean?
waiting for whom?
oh, oh!
do you see?
what? who?
him!
him!—m. de villefort, the king’s attorney? certainly i see him.
then i did not kill him?
really, i think you are going mad, good bertuccio
then he is not dead?
eight!
benedetto?
fatality!
half-past six o’clock has just struck, m. bertuccio
i ordered dinner at that hour, and i do not like to wait;
the dinner waits.
will you conduct the baroness danglars?
gentlemen
what are the two fish?
this one is, i think, a sterlet
and that one, if i mistake not, a lamprey.
just so. now, m. danglars, ask these gentlemen where they are caught.
sterlets
are only found in the volga.
and
exactly; one comes from the volga, and the other from lake fusaro.
impossible!
well, this is just what amuses me
but how could you have these fish brought to france?
i cannot help doubting
baptistin
but why have two of each sort?
merely because one might have died
you are certainly an extraordinary man
and to have ideas
yes
but then ostia is only a few leagues from rome.
true
all this is very extraordinary
certainly not longer.
why not? i am fond of grass and shade
yes
yes, madame
in four days
it is extraordinary!
indeed
m. de saint-méran?
it appears so
is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it?
quite so; my steward transacts all this business for me.
it is certainly ten years since the house had been occupied
it is probable
there was, above all, one room
why so?
why dramatic?
can we account for instinct?
did you hear?
we must go
oh.
it is really frightful.
is it not so?
oh
and then
this is not all.
what is there more?
ah, what else is there?
ah
yes, but you have not this little staircase
what a wicked-looking, crooked staircase
can you imagine
ah, madame
it is very evident what is the matter with her
yes
really, count, you frighten the ladies.
what is the matter?
nothing
will you come into the garden?
no, no
i would rather remain here.
are you really frightened, madame?
oh, no, sir
ah, yes
madame danglars is ill
oh, _mon dieu!_
i have mine
ah
yes
at your advice i have made the trial.
and have you succeeded?
i think so.
ah
what a frightful dream!
really, madame
did i alarm you much?
oh, no, sir
and then, you know
an idea, a supposition, is sufficient.
well
take care
the king’s attorney is here.
ah
your declaration?
yes, before witnesses.
oh, this is very interesting
there has been a crime
stay
here, in this very spot
a newly born infant
this affair becomes serious!
well
who said it was a crime?
how? is it not a crime to bury a living child in a garden?
and pray what do you call such an action?
but who said it was buried alive?
what is done to infanticides in this country?
oh, their heads are soon cut off
ah, indeed?
i think so; am i not right, m. de villefort?
yes, count
come, gentlemen,—some coffee, we seem to have forgotten it
indeed, count
i think madame danglars again requires your bottle
i must speak to you.
when?
tomorrow.
where?
in my office, or in the court, if you like,—that is the surest place.
i will be there.
thanks, my dear friend
and i, sir
shall be most happy to receive you.
what do you want of me?
pardon me, my friend, if i disturb you
but i want to speak to you.
you have no right to beg at night
i am not begging, my fine fellow
come
what do you want? speak quickly, friend.
tell me
tell me what you want?
yes
let me at least reach a shady spot
oh, as for that, i’ll take you to a splendid place
don’t think i want the glory of riding in your fine carriage
come, step in
now, tell me why you come to disturb my tranquillity?
let me ask you why you deceived me?
how have i deceived you?
how does that annoy you?
it does not; on the contrary, i think it will answer my purpose.
so
you are speculating upon me?
what fine words he uses!
i warn you, master caderousse, that you are mistaken.
come, come, what then?
patience—patience!
i am patient, but go on.
so that, as you confess, you are jealous?
yes, and a fine opportunity you have chosen!
you see, i do not conceal myself.
it was very polite of you.
come
what do you want?
do you know then now what you are?
oh, you knew that well enough before speaking to me
true
what an appetite you used to have! is it as good now?
oh, yes
he is not a prince; simply a count.
a count, and a rich one too, eh?
well, what do you want?
i think that with a hundred francs a month——
well?
i could live——
upon a hundred francs!
come—you understand me; but that with——
with?
with a hundred and fifty francs i should be quite happy.
here are two hundred
good!
there now, again you degrade me.
how so?
why do you wish to know?
what? do you again defy me?
no; the fact is, i have found my father.
what? a real father?
yes, so long as he pays me——
you’ll honor and believe him—that’s right. what is his name?
major cavalcanti.
is he pleased with you?
so far i have appeared to answer his purpose.
and who found this father for you?
the count of monte cristo.
the man whose house you have just left?
yes.
well, i will mention you to him. meanwhile, what are you going to do?
i?
yes, you.
it is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me.
ah
who knows?
not at all, my good friend.
how? not at all?
good caderousse
how happy you will be.
i will do my best
wait
we shall see.
but, tell me
am i to remain bareheaded?
pooh
come, come; enough of this
what are you waiting for?
hush
well!
my servant’s coat and my hat?
ah
you would not like me to risk taking cold?
but what am i to do?
alas
domestic hearths
no, hermine
you are deceived, lucien, i assure you
what is my daughter doing?
she practiced all the evening, and then went to bed
yet i think i hear her piano.
well
come and undress me.
my dear m. lucien
madame
true
my study?
at least that of the minister.
why so!
well
go, cornélie
come, hermine
nothing
i am frightful tonight
good-evening, madame
good-evening, m. debray.
read me something, m. debray
excuse me
m. lucien
i am at your service, madame
my dear m. debray
do not think i wish to turn you out, my dear debray
it is extraordinary
do you know, sir
it is because i am in a worse humor than usual
and what have i to do with your ill-humor?
not so
i do not understand you, sir
you understand me perfectly, on the contrary
and pray
am i responsible for this loss?
why not?
is it my fault you have lost 700,000 francs?
certainly it is not mine.
once for all, sir
oh, i can well believe that, for neither of them was worth a penny.
really?
i? what could put such an idea into your head?
yourself.
ah?—what next?
most assuredly.
i should like to know upon what occasion?
when are you coming to the point?
patience, madame, i am coming to it.
that’s fortunate.
well, sir, and what then?
ah, yes, it was just after this that you spoiled everything.
really, your manner of speaking——
well?
for shame!
wretch!
oh, this is too much
but
i find you did not even pause there——
insults!
a probable thing!
sir
but, sir
still it seems to me, that as you profit by it——
foolish creature
m. de villefort!—what do you mean?
pardon me
nay
i have been in ill-luck for several days
ah, indeed?
really? does it happen to be jacopo manfredi?
really?
then you really lost by that affair in spain?
yes; only 700,000 francs out of my cash box—nothing more!
why, how could you make such a mistake—such an old stager?
then you do not speculate?
then you believe the papers?
well, that’s what puzzles me
so that
not nearly, indeed; that is exactly my loss.
_diable!_
third-rate
what do you mean by that?
certainly
confound it, yes!
oh
let us imagine seven such months
what a bad calculator you are!
no, for i am only embarked in certainties
well, such things have been.
that there should be a famine!
recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine.
so much the better. i congratulate you, my dear m. danglars
i think i may aspire to that honor
tell me what i am to do for m. cavalcanti.
but that is not all
may i ask how much he allows the young man?
five thousand francs per month.
oh, by the house of fenzi, one of the best in florence.
would you not trust the cavalcanti?
the young man is better
why?
ah, i believe noblemen marry amongst themselves, do they not?
they like to unite their fortunes.
do you think so?
i am sure of it.
and you have heard his fortune mentioned?
and what is your opinion?
well, and it is that——
certainly
ah, he has a palace?
come, you do not flatter him.
_ma foi_
albert
but he is betrothed to your daughter, i believe?
you do not mean to say that it would not be a good match?
oh, i do not mean her fortune only; but tell me——
what?
why did you not invite m. and madame de morcerf to your dinner?
yes, yes
why so?
because it is the air she always breathed in her youth.
but still, if albert be not so rich as mademoiselle danglars
you must allow that he has a fine name?
so he has; but i like mine as well.
and for this very reason
still, i should not think the morcerfs would yield to the cavalcanti?
the morcerfs!—stay, my dear count
i think so.
and you understand heraldry?
a little.
well, look at my coat-of-arms, it is worth more than morcerf’s.
why so?
well, what then?
while his name is not morcerf.
how?—not morcerf?
not the least in the world.
go on.
impossible!
a proof of great humility or great pride
well, when i was a clerk, morcerf was a mere fisherman.
and then he was called——
fernand.
only fernand?
fernand mondego.
you are sure?
_pardieu!_ i have bought enough fish of him to know his name.
then, why did you think of giving your daughter to him?
what?
oh, nothing!
in conjunction with the affairs of ali pasha?
exactly so.
this is the mystery
it would be very easy if you much wished it?
how so?
probably you have some correspondent in greece?
i should think so.
at yanina?
everywhere.
you are right
do so.
i will.
and if you should hear of anything very scandalous——
i will communicate it to you.
you will oblige me.
walk in, madame
thanks, madame,—thanks for your punctuality;
it is a long time, madame
it is true, then
sir
and i
you?
yes, i.
i think, sir, you exaggerate your situation
madame
in any case, sir, you will allow
poor thing
well?
ah
what is there more to hear?
how has this terrible past been recalled?
alas
doubtless it is chance.
chance?
well, no, madame,—this is the terrible news i have to tell you
what can you mean?
neither of them there?
neither of them there!
no
oh, you frighten me! but speak; i will listen.
we thought it dead
the chest no longer there?
think not i contented myself with this one effort
oh, heaven!
oh
it was enough to drive you mad!
i hoped for a moment that it might
but you said
what then?
my child was alive?
i know not; i merely suppose so, as i might suppose anything else
ah, my child, my poor child!
you understand, then, that if it were so
just god, avenging god!
but the child—the child, sir?
how i have searched for him
impossible!
perhaps
oh, yes, yes
my child is there!
truly, truly
no, it was not dead.
do i know?
they lost her?
yes, forever.
and this is all?
oh, no
but
oh, the wickedness of man is very great
no.
but have you ever watched him carefully?
and you see you would have been deceived.
yes, doubtless.
never, to anyone.
you understand me
yes, yes, i understand very well
no, my life has been passed in frivolity; i wish to forget it myself.
do you talk in your sleep?
i sleep soundly, like a child; do you not remember?
it is true
well?
well, i understand what i now have to do
here i am, dear count.
welcome home again.
i arrived an hour since.
from dieppe?
no, from tréport.
indeed?
and i have come at once to see you.
that is extremely kind of you
and what is the news?
you should not ask a stranger, a foreigner, for news.
had you commissioned me?
come, come
possibly
indeed! pray tell me how it happened.
willingly. m. danglars dined with me.
i know it; to avoid meeting him, my mother and i left town.
but he met here m. andrea cavalcanti.
your italian prince?
not so fast; m. andrea only calls himself count.
calls himself, do you say?
yes, calls himself.
is he not a count?
did they speak of me?
not a word.
so much the worse.
why so? i thought you wished them to forget you?
touching sympathy! so you hate each other?
listen
and this
you are difficult to please, viscount.
yes, for i often wish for what is impossible.
what is that?
to find such a wife as my father found.
your father was fortunate, then?
worldling
one plan occurred to me
apropos
i?
and you include me in the expression everyone—many thanks!
let us not mistake
but m. d’épinay, unlike you, bears his misfortune patiently.
which they deserve, do they not?
there is, then, one
because i am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps
indeed, my dear sir
i foppish? how do you mean?
bah!
i would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so.
am i, indeed, so happy?
but yet, m. danglars appeared——
a ball at this season?
summer balls are fashionable.
when will it take place?
on saturday.
m. cavalcanti’s father will be gone.
but the son will be here; will you invite young m. cavalcanti?
i do not know him, viscount.
you do not know him?
but you receive him at your house?
where?
at your ball.
why should you not be there?
because you have not yet invited me.
but i come expressly for that purpose.
you are very kind, but i may be prevented.
tell me what it is.
my mother begs you to come.
the comtesse de morcerf?
ah, count
you have talked of me?
yes, that is the penalty of being a living puzzle!
i thank you for the warning
you will, then, come on saturday?
yes, since madame de morcerf invites me.
you are very kind.
will m. danglars be there?
‘never despair of anything,’ says the proverb.
do you dance, count?
i dance?
yes, you; it would not be astonishing.
never; you can talk to her, she so delights in your conversation.
indeed?
i have one thing to reproach myself with
what is it?
i have spoken to you indiscreetly about danglars.
on the contrary, speak to me always in the same strain about him.
five or six days hence at the latest.
and when is he to be married?
immediately on the arrival of m. and madame de saint-méran.
i will obey your orders, my lord.
good-bye.
until saturday, when i may expect you, may i not?
yes, i promised you.
what news?
she went to the palais
did she stay long there?
an hour and a half.
did she return home?
directly.
well, my dear bertuccio
no, he went out early this morning
i might not always be content with that answer
i told you he was not at home
doubtless, unless he is at work, which is the same as if he were out.
i will come again at that time
is the abbé at home?
yes; he is at work in his library, but he expects you, sir
have i the honor of addressing the abbé busoni?
yes, sir
exactly, sir.
one of the agents appointed to secure the safety of paris?
yes, sir
i am at your service, sir
the mission with which i am charged, sir
excuse me, abbé
now, sir, i am listening—go on.
you mean monsieur zaccone, i presume?
zaccone?—is not his name monte cristo?
absolutely the same.
let us speak of m. zaccone.
agreed.
i asked you if you knew him?
extremely well.
who is he?
the son of a rich shipbuilder in malta.
however
are you sure of what you assert?
what do you mean by that question?
i knew his father, m. zaccone.
ah, indeed?
and when a child i often played with the son in the timber-yards.
but whence does he derive the title of count?
you are aware that may be bought.
in italy?
everywhere.
and his immense riches, whence does he procure them?
they may not be so very great.
how much do you suppose he possesses?
from one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per annum.
that is reasonable
two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital.
but i was told he had four millions per annum.
that is not probable.
do you know this island of monte cristo?
i am told it is a delightful place?
it is a rock.
and why has the count bought a rock?
you have, doubtless, heard the adventures of m. zaccone’s youth?
the father’s?
no, the son’s.
was he in the wars?
i think he entered the service.
in what branch?
in the navy.
are you not his confessor?
no, sir; i believe he is a lutheran.
a lutheran?
does he wear them?
he is a quaker then?
exactly, he is a quaker, with the exception of the peculiar dress.
has he any friends?
yes, everyone who knows him is his friend.
but has he any enemies?
one only.
what is his name?
lord wilmore.
where is he?
he is in paris just now.
can he give me any particulars?
important ones; he was in india with zaccone.
do you know his abode?
are you at variance with the englishman?
i love zaccone, and he hates him; we are consequently not friends.
andrea?
no, bartolomeo, his father.
what is it, sir?
certainly, for he told me.
what is it, sir?
i have heard of it.
it is a magnificent charity.
you are a great almsgiver
however——
you know, sir, i do not speak french?
i know you do not like to converse in our language
but you may use it
i understand it.
and i
aw?
i understand
perfectly.
but
do you know why he came to france?
he is speculating in railways
how much does he spend yearly?
not more than five or six hundred thousand francs
he is a miser.
do you know his house at auteuil?
certainly.
what do you know respecting it?
do you wish to know why he bought it?
yes.
what was the cause of your quarrel?
when he was in england he seduced the wife of one of my friends.
why do you not seek revenge?
i have already fought three duels with him
and what was the result of those duels?
but
aw?
you are going to madame de morcerf’s, are you not?
no
i am too ill.
you are wrong
do you think so?
i do.
in that case i will go.
you are looking for my daughter?
i confess it
well, what do you wish to know?
will not the count of monte cristo be here tonight?
seventeen!
what do you mean?
i only mean that the count seems the rage
and have you replied to everyone as you have to me?
were you at the opera yesterday?
no.
he was there.
ah, indeed? and did the eccentric person commit any new originality?
i wager anything
well, what is it?
if i guess rightly, will you confess it?
yes.
on your honor?
on my honor.
yes,—yesterday.
what did he tell you?
that he was leaving at the same time as his letter.
well, now then, the count?
the count will come, of that you may be satisfied.
you know that he has another name besides monte cristo?
no, i did not know it.
monte cristo is the name of an island, and he has a family name.
i never heard it.
well, then, i am better informed than you; his name is zaccone.
it is possible.
he is a maltese.
the son of a shipowner.
well, i’m sure
why so?
because it is a secret just discovered.
by whom?
the police.
then the news originated——
poor count! and is he aware of the danger he has been in?
i think not.
madame
have you seen my mother?
i have just had the pleasure
indeed?
come
very likely
indeed?
so this gentleman is an academician?
within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly.
and what is his especial talent?
and he is made a member of the academy of sciences for this?
no; of the french academy.
but what has the french academy to do with all this?
i was going to tell you. it seems——
no; that his style of writing is very good.
and the other one?
that one?
yes, the third.
the one in the dark blue coat?
yes.
and what are his claims to the peerage?
bravo, viscount
what is it?
ah! is it you, baron?
why do you call me baron?
certainly
which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of july
unfortunately
indeed?
ah, _mon dieu!_
yes, but it is too late
i have honored their bills.
then
here are 200,000 francs gone after——
hush, do not mention these things
especially before young m. cavalcanti;
albert
did you notice that?
what, mother?
but your house is not m. de morcerf’s
well?
well, he has taken nothing yet.
the count is very temperate.
approach him
but why, mother?
just to please me, albert
well
you see he refuses?
yes; but why need this annoy you?
and besides
in a word
do not detain those gentlemen here, count
ah
we will not go alone to the garden.
then
i will lead the way.
it was too warm in the room, was it not, count?
but you
do you know where i am leading you?
no, madame
but you see i make no resistance.
see, count
do you refuse?
pray excuse me, madame
take this peach, then
really, you pain me.
count
i know it, madame
but
certainly, we are friends
why should we not be?
sir
i have suffered deeply, madame
but now you are happy?
doubtless
since no one hears me complain.
and your present happiness, has it softened your heart?
my present happiness equals my past misery
are you not married?
i, married?
you live alone, then?
i do.
you have no sister—no son—no father?
i have no one.
how can you exist thus without anyone to attach you to life?
yes
never.
never?
i never returned to the country where she lived.
to malta?
yes; malta.
she is, then, now at malta?
i think so.
and have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer?
her,—yes.
but only her; do you then still hate those who separated you?
i hate them? not at all; why should i?
take some
madame, i never eat muscatel grapes
inflexible man!
oh, mother
what? what has happened?
m. de villefort is here.
well?
he comes to fetch his wife and daughter.
why so?
and how was m. de saint-méran related to mademoiselle de villefort?
ah, indeed!
albert, albert
we are friends; are we not?
do not my mother and you agree?
on the contrary
no
but why should he wish to enlighten himself upon the subject?
oh, sir
why, what can have happened?
m. de saint-méran is dead
dead!—so suddenly?
a week ago
of course you sent for a doctor?
immediately; but, as i have told you, it was too late.
and what did you do then?
oh! my poor mother!
rest yourself, mother
oh, father, some misfortune has happened!
your grandmamma has just arrived, valentine
and grandpapa?
tell him i will come when i leave my dear grandmamma
yes, yes
alas, sir
mademoiselle valentine?
do you wish to see her?
yes
yes, yes
ah, yes, happily i have
oh, dear grandmamma, are you worse?
no, my child, no
my father?
yes, i wish to speak to him.
sir
yes, madame
your intended son-in-law is named m. franz d’épinay?
yes, madame.
the same.
our civil dissensions are now happily extinguished, mother
is it a suitable match?
in every respect.
and the young man?
is regarded with universal esteem.
you approve of him?
he is one of the most well-bred young men i know.
well, sir
you, madame?
you, dear mamma?
i know what i am saying
ah, madame
it shall be as you wish, madame
my dear grandmother
my child
still that idea of death, madame
madame
it was the fever that disturbed you, madame
oh, dear mother, it was a dream.
but she saw no one?
oh, madame
never, never, never
we expect him every moment.
ah, grandmamma
a doctor?
what are you drinking, dear grandmamma?
the notary, the notary!
the notary!
let him come in.
go, valentine
and leave me with this gentleman.
but, grandmamma——
leave me—go!
oh
antoinette is very well
no
i know nothing.
alas
m. de saint-méran?
yes.
suddenly?
from an apoplectic stroke.
an apoplectic stroke?
where is she?
in her room with the notary.
and m. noirtier?
and the same love for you—eh, my dear child?
yes
he was very fond of me.
who does not love you?
it is singular
it is the first time i ever saw her in this condition
we will go and see
go upstairs
and you?
you here at this hour?
yes, my poor girl
this is, indeed, a house of mourning
dear valentine
i will tell you all
alas
i was at the house of monte cristo an hour since
poor maximilian!
listen
what do you say, maximilian?
you are right
in what a tone you speak!
i speak as one who admires you, mademoiselle.
mademoiselle
but, _mon dieu!_ tell me, how can i do otherwise?
it is not for me to say.
you are wrong; you must advise me what to do.
do you seriously ask my advice, valentine?
valentine
what do you advise?
i am free
you make me tremble!
follow me
i feared it, maximilian
yes,—if i die!
well, valentine
again you drive me to despair, maximilian
mademoiselle
but, in a word, what are you going to do?
oh!
adieu, valentine, adieu!
where are you going?
where are you going?
before you leave me, tell me what you are going to do, maximilian.
speak, speak!
i entreat you.
has your resolution changed, valentine?
it cannot change, unhappy man; you know it must not!
then adieu, valentine!
where are you going?
oh, fear not
on whom, then!—on me?
on yourself, then, unhappy man; on yourself?
i am the only guilty person, am i not?
maximilian!
maximilian, come back, i entreat you!
listen, my dear, my adored valentine
oh, for pity’s sake
you will live, will you not?
no, on my honor
maximilian
adieu, valentine
my god
valentine
truly
no
we will wait, then
yes, we will wait
i rely on you, valentine
then you have my promise, maximilian.
instead of signing——
you are right, valentine; but how shall i ascertain?
from the notary, m. deschamps.
i know him.
yes
adieu, then, till we meet again
i shall hear from you?
yes.
thanks, thanks, dear love, adieu!
valentine de villefort.
here i am, maximilian; come and help me.
it is impossible
in that case
ah, my dear doctor
my dear m. de villefort
what can you mean?
can it be possible?
are we quite alone, my friend?
yes, quite; but why all these precautions?
because i have a terrible secret to communicate to you
let us sit down.
dead, dead!
speak, doctor—i am listening
grief has consumed her
it is not grief, my dear villefort
were you present during the last struggle?
i was
you begged me not to leave.
and at the third she expired.
yes, before others
but now we are alone——
what are you going to say? oh, spare me!
listen
do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend?
can it be possible?
oh, it is impossible
doubtless i may, but——
but?
but i do not think so.
has anyone besides me seen madame de saint-méran?
no.
has anything been sent for from a chemist’s that i have not examined?
nothing.
had madame de saint-méran any enemies?
not to my knowledge.
would her death affect anyone’s interest?
indeed, my dear friend
of whom?—how?—of what?
for my father?
yes.
why do you ask me that?—what do you wish?
and you will find traces of poison?
what do you propose to me, d’avrigny?
my dear m. de villefort
i thank you, doctor
my friend
valentine
what voices?
your servants
but it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here, love.
forgive me
i will go away.
no
you might meet someone; stay.
but if anyone should come here——
no one will come
but what has become of m. d’épinay?
alas
but what redoubles my sorrow
hark!
it is my father, who has just left his study.
to accompany the doctor to the door
how do you know it is the doctor?
i imagined it must be
now
there is but one way left you that is safe
come
where?
to my grandfather’s room.
i in m. noirtier’s apartment?
yes.
can you mean it, valentine?
be careful, valentine
yes
valentine
death is in itself sacred.
yes
besides, it will not be for long.
barrois
shut the door, and let no one come in.
dear grandfather.
to you alone, then, may i confide my sorrows and my hopes?
yes.
look attentively, then, at this gentleman.
it is m. maximilian morrel
yes
well, grandpapa
you like m. maximilian morrel, do you not, grandpapa?
yes.
mademoiselle
that is it
do you fear he will not understand?
yes.
he knows everything i know
but first
and now
yes
no
we must not do so?
no.
you do not sanction our project?
no.
there is another way
which?
i will go
you wish to know what i will do?
yes.
no.
no?
i do
but what then must be done?
i understand
i am to wait.
yes.
but delay may ruin our plan, sir
no.
do you prefer i should seek m. d’épinay?
no.
whence then will come the help we need—from chance?
no.
from you?
yes.
yes.
you are sure of it?
yes.
then i must wait?
yes.
but the contract?
yes
the contract shall not be signed!
no
what do you wish, sir?
shall i swear to you, sir?
yes
i swear to you, on my honor
that is right
now
do you wish me to retire?
yes.
without seeing mademoiselle valentine?
yes.
but
franz assured me
but of what disease, then, did she die?
nearly.
it is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy
at any rate
that is a tenacious old grandfather
ideas and men appeared the same to him
you here?
i am no acquaintance of m. de villefort’s
the time and place are but ill-suited for an introduction.
mademoiselle de villefort is in deep sorrow, is she not?
extremely
this is a magnificent habitation
but tell me
i am prejudiced against beauchamp
at what time you please, sir
as soon as possible.
i am at your command, sir; shall we return together?
if not unpleasant to you.
on the contrary, i shall feel much pleasure.
m. d’épinay
sir
in that case
then
but the mourning?
don’t be uneasy on that score
as you please, sir
then
sir
i have one request to make.
what is it?
i prefer going, sir.
are you m. franz de quesnel, baron d’épinay?
yes, sir
yes.
sir
besides, sir
gentlemen
it is impossible
it is at this moment
grandpapa noirtier can speak now, then
tell m. nortier
then, m. nortier gives notice to these gentlemen
that he will give orders to be carried to the drawing-room.
pray go, valentine
stop
i will go with you.
excuse me, sir
pray, sir
forgive me, sir
listen
here is m. franz d’épinay
shall i open the secretaire?
yes
and the drawers?
yes.
those at the side?
no.
the middle one?
yes.
no.
but there are no more
yes, i understand, grandfather
secret.
ah! is there a secret spring?
yes
and who knows it?
barrois?
yes.
shall i call him?
yes.
barrois
obey
is that what you wish for?
yes.
shall i give these papers to m. de villefort?
no.
to mademoiselle valentine?
no.
to m. franz d’épinay?
yes.
to me, sir?
yes.
well, sir
what do you wish me to do with this paper?
to preserve it, sealed up as it is, doubtless
no
do you wish him to read it?
yes
you understand, baron, my grandfather wishes you to read this paper
then let us sit down
sit down
read
february 5th, 1815!
go on.
but it was on leaving this club
my father disappeared.
read.
i have my carriage here
‘“our coachman is a member of the club
‘“then we run another risk
sure enough
and hence
read again
‘“well
general
‘“excuse me, gentlemen
‘“sir
ah, my father!
‘“sir
‘“i am a royalist
‘“and you, sir
‘“then you must die
general
close the doors
‘“general
‘“now am i at liberty to retire?
where do you wish to be taken?
anywhere out of your presence
beware, sir
why do you stop here?
‘“because, sir
‘“another method of assassination?
at last
ah
they have sent some fencing-master to fight with me.
‘signed, beaurepaire, duchampy, and lecharpal.’
sir
mademoiselle
hold, sir
oh, misery
do what you can—make me understand in some way!
yes
oh, mademoiselle, mademoiselle!
yes.
m
yes!
you!
yes!
have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano?
alas, no, sir
well
hem
i see that you participate in a prevalent error
what is it?
that m. danglars speculates, whereas he never does.
nor i
which?
m. debray had told you——
i was once very fond of it, but i do not indulge now.
stay
what has happened?
yes
but that is not all.
not all!
no; they were going to marry their daughter——
to m. franz d’épinay. is it broken off?
yesterday morning, it appears, franz declined the honor.
indeed? and is the reason known?
no.
how extraordinary! and how does m. de villefort bear it?
as usual. like a philosopher.
well
and mademoiselle d’armilly
i will not answer for it
why?
oh, you are a thorough democrat
but do you see to what you are exposing yourself?
you may well say, perchance
still, situated as we are——
let her alone
she is quite well
they suit each other remarkably well
i, too
it is of no consequence.
what prince?
prince cavalcanti
pardon me
may i also be allowed
wait a moment
indeed
what do you think of our lover?
he appears cool. but, then your word is given.
oh
hem
why do you doubt?
the past—that obscurity on the past.
but that does not affect the son.
very true.
but i do.
have you made inquiry?
i am not so sure of that.
and yet you said he had money.
fifty thousand livres—a mere trifle.
he is well educated.
hem
he is a musician.
so are all italians.
come, count, you do not do that young man justice.
what a puritan you are!
that happens every day.
indeed.
positively.
i?—where the devil did you find out that?
ah, baron, baron
oh, don’t worry about me, sir mocker
but will you undertake to speak to the father?
willingly, if you wish it.
yes, sir, i will give my attention to the subject.
bravi! bravo! brava!
i shall soon return
come
come, louise
i have just received my courier from greece
ah, yes
yes.
how is king otho getting on?
we shall go together, shall we not?
if you like
did you see
yes
indeed, i did; and what does he mean by his news from greece?
how can i tell you?
because i imagine you have correspondents in that country.
stop
if you compliment her at all, let it be on her voice, at least
no, everyone would do that.
my dear viscount, you are dreadfully impertinent.
indeed?
he is going with me. shall i send the father to you?
immediately.
very well.
well
to what do you allude?
to the installation of my rival at m. danglars’.
what rival?
_ma foi!_ what rival? why, your protégé, m. andrea cavalcanti!
what, do you think he is paying his addresses?
what does that signify, so long as they favor your suit?
what!
but the father has the greatest regard possible for you
jealousy indicates affection.
true; but i am not jealous.
he is.
of whom?—of debray?
no, of you.
you are mistaken, my dear viscount.
prove it to me.
do you wish me to do so?
yes.
by whom are you charged?
by the baron himself.
oh
certainly i shall, albert, as i have promised to do it.
well
there has been a misunderstanding.
what, with the baroness?
no, with the baron.
has he perceived anything?
ah, that is a good joke!
do you think he suspects?
where have you come from, my dear count?
from congo, if you will.
it must be farther off than even that.
but what do i know of your parisian husbands?
here we are
certainly, i will.
my carriage shall take you back.
no, thank you; i gave orders for my _coupé_ to follow me.
there it is, then
you will make tea for us, baptistin
really, my dear count
_ma foi_, i should like to smoke.
it is quite wonderful
oh no, it is as simple as possible
oh, that is charming
hush
and you think she would be angry?
no, certainly not
she is very amiable, then, is she not?
undoubtedly.
she must be a princess then.
you are right; and she is one of the greatest in her country too.
and is her name a secret?
certainly; on my word of honor.
you know the history of the pasha of yanina, do you not?
true, i had forgotten that.
well, what is haydée to ali tepelini?
merely his daughter.
what? the daughter of ali pasha?
of ali pasha and the beautiful vasiliki.
and your slave?
_ma foi_, yes.
but how did she become so?
say on.
well?
i think i may venture to ask you this favor.
you may venture to ask me anything.
well then, my dear count, present me to your princess.
i will do so; but on two conditions.
i accept them at once.
very well
i swear i will not.
i give you my oath that i will not.
tell haydée
now, understand me
agreed.
let us go in
whom do you bring?
is it a friend, a brother, a simple acquaintance, or an enemy.
a friend
what is his name?
in what language would you like me to converse with him?
do you know modern greek
alas! no
then
you will speak in italian
sir
you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and master.
oh, take it—take it
my dear host, and you, signora
i speak sufficient italian to enable me to converse with you, sir
on what subject shall i converse with her?
oh
i left it when i was but five years old
and have you any recollection of your country?
and how far back into the past do your recollections extend?
and how old were you at that time?
i was three years old
everything.
count
what are you saying to her?
then
it is very strange
i think it is a fine country
so young
εἰπέ—speak.
speak, speak, signora
i beg you to do so
soon
you were saying, signora
and this officer
do you remember his name, signora?
no
go on, my child
and do you not remember the frenchman’s name?
i do not recollect it
courage.
it is a frightful story, count
oh, it is nothing
because, my lord
then
you became the property of this man?
no
of whom i bought her
oh, you are good, you are great, my lord!
and i am very fortunate in belonging to such a master!
come, finish your cup of coffee
we are saved!
saved?
by whom?
at some future time i will tell you all about it.
but when will that be?
when i am your wife.
sir
i come to entreat you, sir
may i hope, sir
in that case, sir
well, baron
to what do you allude, monsieur?
ah
to reflect?
count
i do not understand you, baron
excuse me
but is it a play we are acting?
a play?
that is quite my desire.
you have seen m. de monte cristo have you not?
i see him very often
i did say so.
have you so soon changed your mind
these are all so many empty words, my dear sir
i am not without a good reason for my conduct
what do you mean to say?
no, sir
i merely suspend my decision, that is all.
my dear danglars
and towards whom do you bear this personal ill-feeling, then?
nothing of the kind, sir
calumnies, did you say, sir?
does anyone dare to slander me?
then, sir, i am patiently to submit to your refusal?
enough, sir
we will speak no more on the subject.
very good
did he take baptistin with him?
no, my lord.
call him, then; i wish to speak to him.
my good friend
he is really out, sir
out, even to me?
i know how happy my master always is to receive the vicomte
no, i think not, for he ordered his breakfast at ten o’clock.
you may depend on my doing so, sir
is the count shooting in the gallery?
yes, sir
excuse me, my lord
what for, philip?
not even before you, philip? then who loads his pistol?
his servant.
a nubian?
a negro.
it is he, then.
do you know this gentleman?
yes, and i am come to look for him; he is a friend of mine.
i ask your pardon, my dear count
what on earth are you talking of?
i am to fight today.
for what?
for the sake of fighting!
i fight in the cause of honor.
ah, that is something serious.
so serious, that i come to beg you to render me a service.
what is it?
to be my second.
come in, my lord
ah, ha
i see you were preparing for a game of cards.
no
i was making a suit.
how?
_diable!_
what would you have, my dear viscount?
you see i am perfectly composed
with whom are you going to fight?
with beauchamp.
one of your friends!
of course; it is always with friends that one fights.
i suppose you have some cause of quarrel?
i have.
what has he done to you?
well
what do you see in that to annoy you?
what do i see in it?
did your father serve under ali pasha?
oh, my dear viscount, do talk reason!
i do not desire to do otherwise.
beauchamp will never retract.
then we must fight.
yes.
you do wrong.
did he reflect before he insulted my father?
ah, my dear count, you are far too indulgent.
well.
supposing the assertion to be really true?
a son ought not to submit to such a stain on his father’s honor.
that is precisely the fault of the age.
and do you undertake to reform it?
yes, as far as i am personally concerned.
well, you are indeed exacting, my dear fellow!
yes, i own it.
are you quite impervious to good advice?
not when it comes from a friend.
and do you account me that title?
certainly i do.
from whom?
from haydée.
you reject this means of information, then?
i do—most decidedly.
then let me offer one more word of advice.
do so, then, but let it be the last.
you do not wish to hear it, perhaps?
on the contrary, i request it.
that would be contrary to all custom.
your case is not an ordinary one.
and what is your reason for advising me to go alone?
because then the affair will rest between you and beauchamp.
explain yourself.
they will not be strangers, they will be friends.
so you recommend——
i recommend you to be prudent.
then you advise me to go alone to beauchamp?
i believe you are right.
i am glad of it.
then i will go alone.
go; but you would do better still by not going at all.
that is impossible.
my dear viscount
why?
do so, then.
that, too, is impossible.
what a singular being you are!—you will not interfere in anything.
you are right—that is the principle on which i wish to act.
we will say no more about it, then. good-bye, count.
this way, this way, my dear albert!
beauchamp
it is of your journal that i come to speak.
indeed? what do you wish to say about it?
i desire that a statement contained in it should be rectified.
to what do you refer? but pray sit down.
thank you
what is it?
the story sent you from yanina.
yanina?
here, i have brought mine with me
you see it is a serious annoyance
is the officer referred to a relation of yours, then?
yes
well, what do you wish me to do for you?
my dear beauchamp, i wish you to contradict this statement.
come
well
you insist?
yes, i insist.
nor do i wish to be there
he is merely my father
is it your father?
you will retract this assertion, will you not, beauchamp?
yes
immediately?
when i am convinced that the statement is false.
what?
but what is there to investigate, sir?
sir
yes, if you will not consent to retract that infamous calumny.
yes, i insist on it
and if i refuse to retract, you wish to fight, do you?
yes
well
sir
certainly, my dear sir.
i maintain my original resolution.
three weeks!
well, let it be three weeks then
m. albert de morcerf
ah
there goes a happy man!
am i to say what you told me?
monsieur morrel
oh, i am listening with the greatest impatience
speak, i beg of you.
my grandfather intends leaving this house
i?
and what?
have i not explained your wishes, grandpapa?
yes
oh
until that time
and i swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes, sir
not only with resignation, but with cheerfulness.
therefore
how hot you look, my good barrois
come, barrois
the fact is, mademoiselle
take some, then, and come back immediately.
it is past noon
yes
barrois
barrois!
i am coming, mademoiselle
barrois will open the door for you
i promised him to wait
and i will wait.
who rang?
doctor d’avrigny
what is the matter, barrois?
he is going to fall!
ah, sir
m. d’avrigny, m. d’avrigny
my master, my good master!
doctor, doctor! come instantly, pray come!
madame, madame!
what is the matter?
oh! come! come!
but where is the doctor?
where is he?
in the name of heaven, madame
has he eaten anything lately?
madame
ah
he has such a short neck
madame
he is with edward, who is not quite well
take this
go away as quick as you can, maximilian
what do you prescribe, doctor?
yes.
send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic.
must i go too?
yes, mademoiselle, you especially
look, look, doctor
how do you feel, barrois?
a little better, sir.
will you drink some of this ether and water?
i will try; but don’t touch me.
why not?
drink.
where do you suffer?
everywhere. i feel cramps over my whole body.
do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes?
yes.
any noise in the ears?
frightful.
when did you first feel that?
just now.
suddenly?
yes, like a clap of thunder.
did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before?
nothing.
no drowsiness?
none.
what have you eaten today?
where is this lemonade?
downstairs in the decanter.
whereabouts downstairs?
in the kitchen.
shall i go and fetch it, doctor?
is this the decanter you spoke of?
yes, doctor.
is this the same lemonade of which you partook?
i believe so.
what did it taste like?
it had a bitter taste.
it is no doubt the same
yes.
and did you also discover a bitter taste?
yes.
oh, doctor
that emetic, villefort—see if it is coming.
if i had anything by means of which i could inflate the lungs
oh, sir
a pen, a pen!
how do you find yourself?—well?
yes.
yes.
yes.
did barrois make your lemonade?
yes.
was it you who asked him to drink some of it?
no.
was it m. de villefort?
no.
madame?
no.
it was your granddaughter, then, was it not?
yes.
barrois
can you speak?
try and make an effort to do so, my good man.
who made the lemonade?
i did.
did you bring it to your master directly it was made?
no.
you left it somewhere, then, in the meantime?
yes; i left it in the pantry, because i was called away.
who brought it into this room, then?
mademoiselle valentine.
gracious heaven
doctor, doctor!
will they never bring that emetic?
here is a glass with one already prepared
who prepared it?
the chemist who came here with me.
drink it
no, no, friend
you will soon cease to suffer.
ah, i understand you
well?
go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of violets.
do not be alarmed, m. noirtier
you want valentine, do you not? i will tell them to send her to you.
well, how is he now?
come in here
is he still in a fit?
he is dead.
dead?—and so soon too!
yes, it is very soon
what?
are you still harping on that terrible idea?
still, sir; and i shall always do so
look
the unfortunate barrois has been poisoned
oh, death is in my house!
say, rather, crime!
m. d’avrigny
yes
in my house
in my house!
come, magistrate
you make me shudder, doctor. do you talk of a sacrifice?
i do.
do you then suspect anyone?
oh, speak, speak, doctor; i shall have courage.
‘seek whom the crime will profit,’ says an axiom of jurisprudence.
doctor
you acknowledge, then, the existence of the crime?
oh, man!
how? m. noirtier?
but why did it not kill my father?
oh, have pity—have pity!
follow the culprit’s steps; he first kills m. de saint-méran——
oh, doctor!
he first kills m. de saint-méran
then madame de saint-méran,—a double fortune to inherit.
listen attentively.
alas
i do not lose a single word.
m. noirtier
oh, mercy, m. d’avrigny!
have mercy on my child, sir
you see it is yourself who have first named her—you, her father.
m. de villefort
listen
beware
listen
well
i will wait.
only
then you abandon me, doctor?
i entreat you, doctor!
true
we will return.
sir
we must go, for death is in this house.
are you not rather young, m. andrea, to think of marrying?
i think not, sir
well, sir
i
very good, father-in-law
but
which?
that you inherit from your mother.
truly, from my mother, leonora corsinari.
how much may it amount to?
indeed, sir
well, sir
you may not only hope
i am, indeed, rejoiced
but
i have just left the count, sir
and what may you have to say to him?
bring me a million such as that
very well, at ten o’clock; you are still at the hôtel des princes?
yes.
sir
that man has been here.
what man?
him to whom your excellency pays that little annuity.
oh
yes, your excellency.
but
he would not take them.
what? he would not take them?
give it me
very well
poor man, he is a worthy creature.
take out the horses quickly, and come up to me
you are about my height, pierre
i have that honor, your excellency.
you had a new livery yesterday?
yes, sir.
for whom are you looking, my fine fellow?
monsieur pailletin, if you please, my good woman
a retired baker?
exactly.
he lives at the end of the yard, on the left, on the third story.
ah! you are punctual
confound you and your punctuality!
what do you think of it, my little fellow?
but
my boy
hold your tongue, hypocrite
you love me!
yes, i do, or may the devil take me. i know it is a weakness
but it overpowers me.
come
well
that i may have the pleasure of seeing you, my little fellow.
what is the use of seeing me after we have made all our arrangements?
eh, dear friend
well, what have you to say? you have seen your dream realized.
well, you have an annuity.
i have?
yes, since i bring you your two hundred francs.
it is humiliating
what? of danglars?
come, your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong light.
ah, mate
faith, yes
so you like it, you rogue?
do you see
what is that?
do not let that disturb you, i have enough for two.
good caderousse!
so much so, that yesterday i would not take the two hundred francs.
yes, you wished to speak to me; but was it indeed remorse, tell me?
true remorse; and, besides, an idea had struck me.
it is miserable—do you see?—always to wait till the end of the month.
oh
yes.
i was going to say, if i were in your place——
well.
i would realize——
how would you realize?
well, well
that isn’t a bad idea.
my dear friend
but
but how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs?
ah, caderousse
the appetite grows by what it feeds on
and
i have formed a plan.
let me see your plan; i dare say it is a pretty one.
i do not say
well
no
no, i cannot.
i do not think you understand me
it would make very little difference to me
come, caderousse, no nonsense!
well, i’ll see—i’ll try to contrive some way
well, you shall have your five hundred francs
bah
when you have access to countless stores.
true
and my protector is very kind.
that dear protector
five thousand francs.
capital?—yes—i understand—everyone would like capital.
well, and i shall get it.
who will give it to you—your prince?
yes, my prince. but unfortunately i must wait.
you must wait for what?
for his death.
the death of your prince?
yes.
how so?
because he has made his will in my favor.
indeed?
on my honor.
for how much?
for five hundred thousand.
only that? it’s little enough.
but so it is.
no, it cannot be!
are you my friend, caderousse?
yes, in life or death.
well, i will tell you a secret.
what is it?
but remember——
ah! _pardieu!_ mute as a carp.
well, i think——
you think? do not fear; _pardieu!_ we are alone.
i think i have discovered my father.
your true father?
yes.
not old cavalcanti?
no, for he has gone again; the true one, as you say.
and that father is——
well, caderousse, it is monte cristo.
bah!
ah, truly? and you say that by his will——
he leaves me five hundred thousand livres.
are you sure of it?
probably.
and in that codicil he acknowledges me.
oh, the good father, the brave father, the very honest father!
now, say if i conceal anything from you?
yes, he is that; he does not himself know the amount of his fortune.
is it possible?
and you go into that house?
when i like.
how i should like to see all that
it is, in fact, magnificent
and does he not live in the champs-élysées?
yes, no. 30.
ah
no. 30.
have you ever seen the tuileries?
no.
well, it surpasses that.
it is not worthwhile to wait for that
but you should take me there one day with you.
how can i? on what plea?
no nonsense, caderousse!
i will offer myself as floor-polisher.
the rooms are all carpeted.
well, then, i must be contented to imagine it.
that is the best plan, believe me.
try, at least, to give me an idea of what it is.
how can i?
nothing is easier. is it large?
middling.
how is it arranged?
faith, i should require pen, ink, and paper to make a plan.
they are all here
here
draw me all that on the paper, my boy.
high walls?
not more than eight or ten feet.
that is not prudent
in the court are orange-trees in pots, turf, and clumps of flowers.
and no steel-traps?
no.
the stables?
are on either side of the gate, which you see there.
let us see the ground floor
windows?
why the devil have they any stairs with such windows?
luxury has everything.
but shutters?
and where do the servants sleep?
ah, _diable!_ bells did you say?
what do you mean?
yes.
what did he answer?
he quietly said, ‘what do i care if i am?’
andrea, he has some secretaire with a spring.
how do you know?
he has simply a mahogany secretaire, in which the key is always kept.
and he is not robbed?
no; his servants are all devoted to him.
there ought to be some money in that secretaire?
there may be. no one knows what there is.
and where is it?
on the first floor.
that is very simple.
is there a window in the dressing-room?
two,—one here and one there.
does he often go to auteuil?
are you sure of it?
he has invited me to dine there.
there’s a life for you
that is what it is to be rich.
and shall you dine there?
probably.
when you dine there, do you sleep there?
if i like; i am at home there.
when do you want your twelve hundred francs?
now, if you have them.
yellow boys?
no, i thank you.
oh, you despise them.
on the contrary, i esteem them, but will not have them.
you can change them, idiot; gold is worth five sous.
today?
no, tomorrow; i shall not have time today.
well, tomorrow i will leave them when i go to auteuil.
may i depend on it?
certainly.
because i shall secure my housekeeper on the strength of it.
never.
how sprightly you are
no, unfortunately; but when i do obtain it——
well?
i shall remember old friends, i can tell you that.
yes, since you have such a good memory.
what do you want? it looks as if you were trying to fleece me?
what is it?
how so?
you guess well.
i know something of diamonds; i have had some.
you do well to boast of it
it is a false diamond
you are joking now
do not be angry, we can try it.
_confiteor!_
have you finished?
i shall not sell it—do not fear.
not at least till the day after tomorrow
happy rogue
yes
i have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head.
what fortune has she?
but i tell you——
a million?
let it be a million
thank you
oh, i wish it you with all my heart!
stop, let me show you the way.
it is not worthwhile.
yes, it is.
why?
thank you
i will let you know a week beforehand.
dear benedetto
now
your highness had already expressed that wish
that’s well
what are you doing here?
i did not send for you, i think?
important and urgent
they do not want my papers
return to paris
but will no one remain in the house, my lord?
yes, the porter.
my lord will remember that the lodge is at a distance from the house.
well?
the house might be stripped without his hearing the least noise.
by whom?
by thieves.
you understand me?
and those of the first floor?
you know they are never closed. go!
that’s a daring rascal
i see!
ah, ha
by heavens
it is——
don’t stir
try again
ah, good-evening, my dear m. caderousse
the abbé busoni!
the abbé busoni!
yes, undoubtedly, the abbé busoni himself
the abbé, the abbé!
so you would rob the count of monte cristo?
reverend sir
a pane of glass out
come, come
no, reverend sir; i have been liberated by someone.
that someone has done society a great kindness.
ah
i had promised——
and you are breaking your promise!
alas, yes!
reverend sir, i am impelled——
every criminal says the same thing.
poverty——
pshaw!
pardon, reverend sir
that is but poor encouragement.
i am alone
ah, reverend sir
i may indeed say you are my deliverer!
you mean to say you have been freed from confinement?
yes, that is true, reverend sir.
who was your liberator?
an englishman.
what was his name?
lord wilmore.
i know him; i shall know if you lie.
ah, reverend sir, i tell you the simple truth.
was this englishman protecting you?
no, not me, but a young corsican, my companion.
what was this young corsican’s name?
benedetto.
is that his christian name?
he had no other; he was a foundling.
then this young man escaped with you?
he did.
in what way?
i do.
in the hour of rest, between noon and one o’clock——
nay
one can’t always work—one is not a dog.
so much the better for the dogs
and what is become of this benedetto?
i don’t know.
you ought to know.
no, in truth; we parted at hyères.
you lie
reverend sir!
oh, reverend sir!
since you left toulon what have you lived on? answer me!
on what i could get.
you lie
true
how can he be the son of a great lord?
a natural son.
and what is that great lord’s name?
the count of monte cristo, the very same in whose house we are.
benedetto the count’s son?
ah, yes
andrea cavalcanti.
exactly.
why should i stand in a comrade’s way?
you are right; it is not you who should apprise m. danglars, it is i.
do not do so, reverend sir.
why not?
because you would bring us to ruin.
reverend sir
i will expose all.
to whom?
to m. danglars.
by heaven!
ah, mercy—mercy!
rise!
what a wrist you have, reverend sir!
oh!
take this pen and paper, and write what i dictate.
i don’t know how to write, reverend sir.
you lie! take this pen, and write!
sign it!
but would you ruin me?
now
that suffices—begone!
which way?
the way you came.
you wish me to get out at that window?
you got in very well.
oh, you have some design against me, reverend sir.
idiot! what design can i have?
why, then, not let me out by the door?
what would be the advantage of waking the porter?
ah, reverend sir, tell me, do you wish me dead?
i wish what god wills.
but swear that you will not strike me as i go down.
cowardly fool!
what do you intend doing with me?
oh, monsieur
i will
listen—you know if i may be relied on.
yes
if you arrive safely at home——
what have i to fear, except from you?
then?
as true as i am a christian
now begone
now go down
what are you doing, reverend sir? suppose a watchman should pass?
help!
murder! i am dying! help, reverend sir,—help!
help, reverend sir, help!
what is the matter?
help
i am murdered!
we are here;—take courage.
my god!
a surgeon, reverend sir—a surgeon!
i have sent for one
against whom?
against my murderer.
did you recognize him?
yes; it was benedetto.
the young corsican?
himself.
your comrade?
i have also sent for the procureur.
he will not come in time; i feel my life fast ebbing.
wait a moment
hasten, reverend sir, hasten! i shall faint again!
oh
that is life to me; more, more!
two drops more would kill you
oh, send for someone to whom i can denounce the wretch!
shall i write your deposition? you can sign it.
yes, yes
quick, quick!
or i shall be unable to sign it.
ah, you will tell all i have said, will you not, reverend sir?
yes, and much more.
what more will you say?
and he will be guillotined, will be not?
i will say
did you see all that?
and you did not warn me!
patience
have patience!
besides
do you then believe in god?
had i been so unhappy as not to believe in him until now
i must believe on seeing you.
listen
help!
ah
listen
it was not i who wished to kill the jew
yes
_pardieu!_ to transport me for life, how merciful!
give me drink
no one, i tell you, will escape; benedetto will be punished.
i?
i do not believe there is a god
silence
no
there is a providence; there is a god
but who are you, then?
look well at me!
well, the abbé—the abbé busoni.
oh?
i am neither the abbé busoni nor lord wilmore
think again,—do you not recollect me?
yes, indeed
yes, caderousse, you have seen me; you knew me once.
who, then, are you? and why, if you knew me, do you let me die?
by your father’s tomb!
who, then, are you?
i am—i am——
oh, my god, my god!
_one!_
albert
let us first sit down and talk.
rather, sir, before we sit down, i must demand your answer.
albert
what must then be done?
well
what does all this mean?
it means that i have just returned from yanina.
from yanina?
yes.
impossible!
you have been to yanina?
because, in truth, albert——
you hesitate?
yes,—i fear.
not so
on the contrary——
my friend
but what?
the paragraph was correct, my friend.
what? that french officer——
yes.
fernand?
yes.
pardon me, my friend, that man was your father!
my friend
here is a proof of it.
now, albert
i hastened to you
ah, noble fellow!
take these
dear, excellent friend
let all be forgotten as a sorrowful dream
yes, yes
dear albert
well
what still oppresses you, my friend?
i am broken-hearted
come
you think, then, all is not over yet?
i think nothing, my friend; but all things are possible. by the way——
what?
are you going to marry mademoiselle danglars?
why do you ask me now?
how?
you think m. danglars——
no.
the engagement is broken off.
well
let us go out, albert
willingly
since we are out
gladly
let us call—i love him.
ah, ha!
yes
albert will tell you
what is it?
arranging your papers, apparently.
m. cavalcanti’s?
let us not misunderstand each other
and who
what? cavalcanti is going to marry mademoiselle danglars?
certainly! do you come from the end of the world?
and you, count, have made this match?
ah, i understand
on our friend albert’s account.
on my account?
listen
and do you say this wedding is at hand?
i am not aware of it
but
you are not in your usual spirits?
i have a dreadful headache
well, my dear viscount
what is that?
a change.
indeed?
you annoyed, count?
and by what?
what brief?
true
willingly.
then it is settled?
yes, but where?
but where are you really going?
let us go, count.
to sea?
yes.
you accept my proposal?
i do.
thank you, i have just returned from sea.
what? you have been to sea?
yes; i have just made a little excursion to the borromean islands18.
what of that? come with us
ah, you are a good and an excellent friend
beauchamp is a worthy fellow
is he not, albert?
into normandy, if you like.
delightful; shall we be quite retired? have no society, no neighbors?
but shall you be allowed to go into normandy?
i may go where i please.
woman’s, yes; my mother is not woman, but _a_ woman.
ah, yes, indeed
and does she try to make you dislike me?
indeed?
you see, then
at tréport?
yes; or in the neighborhood.
but can we travel forty-eight leagues in eight hours?
easily
do not fear, i have little to prepare.
bertuccio
truly
i never knew till now the delight of speed
precisely
you see, i travel with them.
but you are not always travelling.
but no monarch in europe will be wealthy enough to purchase them.
count, may i suggest one idea to you?
certainly.
why?
because i should never get a better.
probabilities are deceptive.
do you possess that right over bertuccio?
yes.
yes.
florentin here!
is my mother ill?
from whom is this?
from m. beauchamp
did he send you?
poor young man
florentin, is your horse fit to return immediately?
it is a poor, lame post-horse.
in what state was the house when you left?
yes, my mother
count
what has happened?
ali, a horse for m. de morcerf—quick! he is in a hurry!
thank you!
only dismount; another will be immediately saddled.
here i am
well, my poor friend
i expected you.
i think i have some clew.
but first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot.
ah, _pardieu!_
are you interested in the sugar question?
no
what is it?
the article relative to morcerf.
indeed? is it not a curious affair?
who, then, has so correctly informed you?
my lords
what day do you fix?
today i am at your service
yes
what next?
absolutely; and rather from your lips than another’s.
go on
and what effect did this discourse produce?
i acknowledge it affected me, and, indeed, all the committee also
ah
it was she.
who?
haydée.
who told you that?
m. de morcerf
not guilty
my friend
be it so
well, listen, morcerf.
tell me; satisfy my impatience.
say on.
‘danglars.’
he!
oh, yes, if it be true
beware, morcerf, he is already an old man.
i do not condemn you, albert; i only restrain you. act prudently.
ah! _parbleu!_ that’s good
sir
no, sir
what is your errand, then, with me, sir?
i mean
and you, too
indeed, sir
you mistake, sir
sir
yes, miserable wretch!
it is your fault.
my fault?
silence!
i?
yes; you! how came it known?
i suppose you read it in the paper in the account from yanina?
who wrote to yanina?
to yanina?
yes. who wrote for particulars concerning my father?
i imagine anyone may write to yanina.
but one person only wrote!
one only?
yes; and that was you!
you wrote, sir, knowing what answer you would receive.
i, indeed? i assure you
who, then, urged you to write? tell me.
and who thus advised you?
no other than your friend, monte cristo.
the count of monte cristo told you to write to yanina?
yes; and i wrote, and will show you my correspondence, if you like.
sir
i accuse no one, sir
does the count know what answer you received?
yes; i showed it to him.
you are right
sir
listen
yes; and we are going to his house.
reflect, morcerf, one moment before you go.
on what shall i reflect?
on the importance of the step you are taking.
is it more serious than going to m. danglars?
i only fear one thing; namely, to find a man who will not fight.
do not be alarmed
my friend
your mother would die of grief.
my poor mother!
are you quite decided, albert?
yes; let us go.
but do you think we shall find the count at home?
but after his bath?
my master will go to dinner.
and after dinner?
he will sleep an hour.
then?
he is going to the opera.
are you sure of it?
very good
that is all i wished to know.
my dear mother
my son
why do you say so?
m. de monte cristo!
do you say m. de monte cristo is our enemy?
mother
i?
yes, doubtless; and is it not that he may never do us any harm?
mother
well
to the opera.
well
an explanation at the opera?
still, if people will shut themselves up
yesterday i was at your house, sir
i do not understand you, sir
ah, i shall know how to make you leave your home!
well, well
sir
what have you done to him?
i? nothing—at least personally
but there must be some cause for this strange scene.
the count of morcerf’s adventure exasperates the young man.
have you anything to do with it?
indeed?
it is true, nevertheless.
then
how so?
probably
but what shall you do with him?
with whom?
with albert.
ah, count
his father loves him so much!
do not speak to me of that
i will make him suffer.
count, count!
dear maximilian
come in
be seated.
sir
and that means
sir
come
there are all my hopes about to be destroyed.
how so?
yet
m. beauchamp
sir
i am, sir, a living guaranty
then i have only to make arrangements for the duel
it is quite immaterial to me
sure to gain!
certainly
pistols, then, at eight o’clock, in the bois de vincennes
very well, sir
now
certainly
i am at your service, count; still——
what?
it is desirable i should know the real cause.
that is to say, you would rather not?
no.
enough
who is your second witness?
i will answer for him, count.
we will.
_suivez-moi!_
ali, bring me my pistols with the ivory cross.
who are you, madame?
edmond, you will not kill my son!
what name did you pronounce then, madame de morcerf?
yours!
mercédès is dead, madame
fernand, do you mean?
oh, for pity’s sake!
and why do you represent providence?
ah, madame
ah, sir!
but
because you had been arrested, edmond, and were a prisoner.
and why was i arrested? why was i a prisoner?
i do not know
how dreadful!
and that letter——
i bought it for two hundred thousand francs, madame
and the result of that letter——
can it be?
and you are sure the unhappy fernand did that?
forgive, edmond, forgive for my sake, who love you still!
not crush that accursed race?
edmond
mercédès!
revenge yourself, then, edmond
it is written in the good book
edmond
no
what do you ask of me?
oh
so much the better
what do you say, edmond?
i say, since you command me, mercédès, i must die.
but the duel will not take place, edmond, since you forgive?
it will take place
edmond
yes, madame, he shall live
edmond
edmond
i have but one word more to say to you.
edmond
what a fool i was
what?
yet
ridiculous?
i do this, oh, my god
she remembered that she had a son
poor haydée
haydée
did you read it?
oh, my lord
i am going on a journey, dear child
well?
well, if any misfortune happen to me
do you think of dying, my lord?
the wise man, my child, has said, ‘it is good to think of death.’
well, if you die
alas
good
it was time
i am perhaps come too soon, count
morrel
did you doubt it?
but if i were wrong——
but, morrel, albert is your friend?
simply an acquaintance, sir.
you met on the same day you first saw me?
thank you, morrel.
look.
what?
you dead?
why, when all was arranged?
listen, count; the affair is serious and unavoidable.
did you doubt it!
no; the offence was public, and everyone is already talking of it.
well?
have you succeeded?
no; for your skill with the sword is so well known.
ah?—who has betrayed me?
the skilful swordsman whom you have conquered.
and you failed?
they positively refused.
morrel
have you ever seen me fire a pistol?
never.
well, we have time; look.
it is astonishing
look, emmanuel.
count
you are right
and i have none.
you are the offended party, count.
doubtless; what does that imply?
that you will fire first.
i fire first?
and at what distance?
twenty paces.
morrel
do not forget what you have just seen.
i suffer from emotion?
what is that?
break his arm—wound him—but do not kill him.
i will tell you, morrel
and you?
that will be another thing; i shall be brought home.
no, no
as i told you, my dear morrel, m. de morcerf will kill me.
and that ghost——
told me, morrel, that i had lived long enough.
let us go
we are first
excuse me, sir
i like
it seems to me
maximilian
are your affections disengaged?
i love a young girl, count.
do you love her much?
more than my life.
another hope defeated!
that is to the purpose. have you brought your arms?
i?—what for? i hope these gentlemen have theirs.
i will inquire
do; but make no treaty—you understand me?
you need not fear.
excuse me, gentlemen
but i do not see m. de morcerf.
he sent us word this morning
ah
it is only five minutes past eight
oh, i made no allusion of that kind
there is a carriage coming
we had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count
gentlemen
because
what is it?
and i
and i also
and we, too
exactly so
you have probably guessed right.
but, after all these arrangements, he does not come himself
albert is ten minutes after time.
there he comes
how imprudent
and besides
i thank you, gentlemen
sir
m. morrel
stop, gentlemen
in private?
no, sir; before all who are here.
what does he want with me?
i do not know, but he wishes to speak to you.
ah?
i do not think that such is his intention
approach, gentlemen
proceed, sir
sir
now, sir
gentlemen
what happened during the night?
we appear to make a very sorry figure here.
what can it mean?
providence still
indeed, my dear friend
are we not going?
when you please
oh, yes
it is magnificent
assuredly; as for me, i should have been incapable of it
gentlemen
possibly, possibly
that is quite my opinion
thank you, gentlemen
good-bye, albert
good-bye
good-bye
what do you want?
pardon me, sir
well!
i did not like to go to him without first seeing you.
why?
it is probable
the truth.
then i shall say the duel did not take place?
you will say i apologized to the count of monte cristo. go.
what are you doing?
what were you doing?
oh, my mother!
i also
mother
but not mine, mother
albert, my child
i will fulfil all your wishes, my dear mother
i am ready, my son
from the count
i accept it
count
stop a moment
willingly
shall we wait breakfast for you?
no
see what good fortune i brought you!
have you not thought so?
yes
it is miraculous!
what?
what has just happened.
yes
you are right—it is miraculous.
for albert is brave
very brave
and i know he has fought two duels
all owing to your influence
it is well for albert he is not in the army
why?
an apology on the ground!
come
doubtless, doubtless
you will breakfast with me, will you not, morrel?
no; i must leave you at ten o’clock.
your engagement was for breakfast, then?
still you must breakfast somewhere.
but if i am not hungry?
oh
well, count
i will not dispute it.
but you will not make me your confidant, maximilian?
i showed you this morning that i had a heart, did i not, count?
well
go
i will remember it
well, i rely upon your promise. good-bye, then.
good-bye, till we meet again.
well?
she is going to leave her house
and her son?
florentin, his valet, thinks he is going to do the same.
come this way.
go
but first, let haydée be informed that i have returned.
here i am
m. de morcerf!
which
the viscount or the count?
the count.
oh
is it not yet over?
i know not if it is finished, my beloved child
but it is the wretched——
that man cannot injure me, haydée
and what i have suffered
by my father’s tomb
i believe you, my lord, as implicitly as if god had spoken to me
oh
to the champs-élysées
ah, it is m. de morcerf
yes, it is i
had you not a meeting with my son this morning?
i had
it is true, sir
doubtless you made, then, some apology or explanation?
i explained nothing, and it is he who apologized to me.
but to what do you attribute this conduct?
to the conviction, probably, that there was one more guilty than i.
and who was that?
his father.
that may be
i know it, and i expected this result.
you expected my son would be a coward?
m. albert de morcerf is no coward!
sir
oh, no, no
so much the better. are you prepared?
yes, sir.
you know that we shall fight till one of us is dead
until one of us dies
let us start, then; we need no witnesses.
very true
on the contrary
we know so little of each other.
indeed?
oh
fernand
edmond dantès!
home, home.
courage, mother! come, this is no longer our home!
now
yes
well
bravo
and do you know
oh, whatever may be m. noirtier’s reason
an excellent one
indeed?
not very
do you then really suffer?
and what treatment do you adopt for this singular complaint?
a very simple one
but
i know it is very bitter
yes, grandpapa
oh
the sun is not shining
cheer up
yes
fetch the glass of water and the decanter from valentine’s room.
why are the glass and decanter empty?
i do not know
ask her
my dear friend
allow me to present you my sincere congratulations
listen
and then
and
i?
at any rate
it is true
but
excuse me
impossible
ah, my dear friend
what is it?
it is, my dear valentine
i?
indeed
you are very pale!
oh, do not be alarmed; i have been so for many days.
retire, valentine
that poor child
oh, what a clumsy thing i am
you have hurt yourself, perhaps
don’t worry, dear grandpapa
another attack of giddiness
but no
and do you
yes
oh
i told you so!
poor child!
what is the matter?
a physician, a physician,—m. d’avrigny!
whatever you want, morrel, come to me; i have great power.
in his study, monsieur procureur—in his study!
ah
is it you?
yes
what?
have you another invalid?
yes, doctor
yes!
i told you it would be so.
valentine
it is valentine’s turn!
your daughter!
you see you were deceived
each time you have applied to me
let us try first to save the victim before we think of revenging her
come.
what is the matter, maximilian?
yes
i came quickly; i wanted to speak to you.
are all your family well?
thank you, count—thank you
yes, everyone in my family is well.
so much the better; yet you have something to tell me?
yes
are you then come from m. de morcerf’s?
no
is someone dead in his house?
the general has just blown his brains out
oh, what a dreadful event!
not for the countess, or for albert
poor countess
tell me what it is
oh
do you think i love you?
oh, you encourage me, and something tells me there
that i ought to have no secret from you.
i am at your service, and still more my servants.
oh, i cannot live if she is not better.
shall i ring for baptistin?
no, i will go and speak to him myself.
well, have you sent?
yes, and now i shall be more calm.
you know i am waiting
ah, indeed?
yes
and what did the doctor answer?
to what?
to poison.
indeed!
well
my dear friend
besides
it has returned, count
you know of whom i speak, count, do you not?
but it is beginning again, i say!
well
you knew it?
you knew it, and said nothing?
and what is it to me?
but i
i love her!
you love?—whom?
unhappy man
you love valentine,—that daughter of an accursed race!
see
come, come
i tell you to hope. do you understand me?
how so?
when i left her dying?
maximilian
i can do much for you, my friend
she is still alive!
still?
oh, doctor, what a dreadful word is that.
yes
but is she safe?
yes, since she lives.
sir
have you something to tell me?
privately?
yes.
well, i will remain with you.
ah
do you
know anything of this young lady’s illness?
yes
we have no time to lose; i will question, and do you answer me.
yes.
pardon what i am going to say
do you know of what he died!
yes
do you think he died a natural death?
then you have thought that barrois was poisoned?
yes.
do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him?
no.
yes.
then will she die too?
no
then you hope?
yes.
what do you hope?
ah, yes, it is true
do you hope the assassin will be tried?
no.
then you hope the poison will take no effect on valentine?
yes.
it is no news to you
ah, indeed?
yes
to prepare her system to resist poison?
yes.
by accustoming her by degrees——
yes, yes, yes
yes.
and you have succeeded
here, doctor
is what you sent me for.
was this prepared in your presence?
yes
have you not let it go out of your hands?
no.
well
étienne
i quite understand why you ask, sir
very well
there is, then, the second point cleared up, or nearly so
yes, indeed, sir
to practice obedience.
well?
well, sir
but
my reason?
unhappy girl, unhappy girl!
unhappy girl
truly, my daughter
my daughter
my daughter
this is not to the purpose
oh
ruined?
exactly, my daughter; that is precisely what i mean
ruined—yes, that is it.
ah!
oh
then
so much the better, i have a ray of hope left; listen.
i am all attention
m. cavalcanti
that is admirable!
you think i shall deprive you of those three millions
perfectly; you pledge me for three millions, do you not?
but since i tell you
i hope so, if the marriage should take place and confirm my credit.
he shall receive them on returning from the mayor’s20.
very well!
what next? what more do you want?
absolutely.
but what are you up to?
then
yes
and to sign the contract in three days?
yes.
then, in my turn, i also say, very well!
thank you, my child
is the conference ended?
ah, good morning, my dear count
ah, m. andrea
i was going out, sir.
no
you know, my dear count
ah, indeed?
oh, yes
possibly my father-in-law trusted to its general notoriety.
well
yes, indeed she is
above all, she is very rich,—at least, i believe so
very rich, do you think?
and he acknowledges fifteen or twenty millions
without reckoning
ten millions! do you think so? it is magnificent!
without reckoning
not badly, by any means
indeed, i fear it
is your love returned?
i suppose so
which?
that i have been singularly assisted.
nonsense.
i have, indeed.
by circumstances?
no; by you.
by me? not at all, prince
no
you are completely mistaken, sir
oh, then my father has really a very large fortune, count?
it appears so, sir
do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come?
i have been advised of it.
but the three millions?
the three millions are probably on the road.
then i shall really have them?
oh, well
proceed
i understand; well, i am come to ask a favor of you.
of me?
yes, of you.
and pray what may it be?
well, to take his part.
then you refuse me?
but what must be done?
you said just now that you had a hundred friends.
very true, but you introduced me at m. danglars’.
yes, but, by my marriage, you have forwarded that.
but, at least, you will be there?
will all paris be there?
oh, certainly.
well, like all paris, i shall be there too
and will you sign the contract?
i see no objection to that; my scruples do not go thus far.
what is it?
advice.
be careful; advice is worse than a service.
oh, you can give me this without compromising yourself.
tell me what it is.
is my wife’s fortune five hundred thousand livres?
that is the sum m. danglars himself announced.
must i receive it, or leave it in the hands of the notary?
because
well
in that case
well
adieu till then.
i have done my duty, now let others do theirs.
gentlemen, we are about to sign the contract.
future couple
my dear
indeed?
oh, well, what do i care?
as a matter of fact
what, you, count?
but it is not my fault, as i shall endeavor to prove.
you remember
yes
to me?
but
how could that prevent m. de villefort——
in this simple way, madame
possibly
yes
a felon named caderousse.
but go on signing
prince cavalcanti
andrea, andrea
call the prince; inform him that it is his turn to sign
what is the matter, sir?
which of you gentlemen
answers to the name of andrea cavalcanti?
but who then is andrea cavalcanti?
a galley-slave, escaped from confinement at toulon.
and what crime has he committed?
he is accused
ah, what a dreadful thing
in truth, i was fated
i escaped the morcerf only to fall into the cavalcanti.
oh, do not confound the two, eugénie.
what shall we do?
what shall we do?
yes.
why, the same we had intended doing three days since—set off.
how strong and courageous you are!
was happily bought three days since.
have you had it sent where we are to go for it?
yes.
our passport?
here it is.
capital! how did you get this passport?
well
but consider the matter seriously, eugénie!
twenty-three thousand francs
and as much, at least, in pearls, diamonds, and jewels
stop!
what do you fear?
that we may be discovered.
the door is locked.
they may tell us to open it.
they may if they like, but we will not.
you are a perfect amazon, eugénie!
there now
but i cannot
i am not strong enough; do you shut it.
ah, you do well to ask
here
but you?
oh, i am never cold, you know! besides, with these men’s clothes——
will you dress here?
certainly.
shall you have time?
no, truly—you comfort me.
come and help me.
oh, that is very good—indeed, it is very good!
you shall see
oh, the magnificent hair!
and am i not a hundred times better thus?
and do you not think me handsomer so?
oh, you are beautiful—always beautiful!
yes.
what are you looking at?
and they would be right, _pardieu!_
oh, i think you swore, eugénie.
gate!
mademoiselle
indeed
here is the passport
to fontainebleau
what do you say?
i am giving them the slip
you are always right
ah
here we are out of paris.
yes, my dear, the abduction is an accomplished fact
yes, and without violence
i shall bring that forward as an extenuating circumstance
am i to be captured?
ho, friend!
what do you want, sir?
is your horse tired?
will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have?
a very easy thing, if your horse isn’t tired.
i tell you he’ll go like the wind,—only tell me which way to drive.
towards the louvres.
ah, i know the way—you get good sweetened rum over there.
it is likely.
well, will you try and overtake him?
nothing i should like better.
and if we do overtake him?
forty
that’s all right
hop in, and we’re off! who-o-o-pla!
ah
hurry, hurry!
we must overtake him soon.
certainly
my friend
my friend
why is that gendarme there?
now then
they’re after me!
_diable!_
i am lost!
oh, oh
he is not here!
well?
well, my boys
ah, what is that?
some traveller seems impatient
number 3.
run, waiter!
aha!
follow me, mr. commissary!
tread in my steps.
wait an instant
good
yes, brigadier.
for pity’s sake
andrea, the murderer!
eugénie! mademoiselle danglars!
help, help!
save me, i am pursued!
it is too late, they are coming
well, be it so
here he is, here he is!
fly, then!
fly!
or kill yourself!
kill myself?
why should i do so?
why, you said
bah
one has friends.
come, come
oh, oh!
oh, why is not the world a wilderness?
mademoiselle eugénie
eugénie
do you intend opening the door?
first, madame, who are you?
who am i? you know me well enough.
we no longer know anyone, madame.
you must be mad, my friend
where do you come from?
oh, this is too much!
madame, these are my orders; excuse me. your name?
the baroness danglars; you have seen me twenty times.
possibly, madame. and now, what do you want?
well, i have business with the procureur.
is it pressing business?
madame will await my return?
yes; go.
you will excuse this poor fellow, madame
forgive my servants
you too, then, are unhappy?
yes, madame
then you pity me!
sincerely, madame.
and you understand what brings me here?
yes, sir,—a fearful misfortune.
you mean a mischance.
a mischance?
alas, madame
i consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable.
and do you suppose this will be forgotten?
everything will be forgotten, madame
am i come to a friend?
you know that you are, madame
well, then, be more affectionate, my dear villefort
when i hear misfortunes named, madame
i came to ask you, my friend
impostor
you are too late, madame; the orders are issued.
well, should he be arrested—do they think they will arrest him?
i hope so.
at least keep him there till my daughter be married.
impossible, madame; justice has its formalities.
what, even for me?
for all, even for myself among the rest
ah!
yes, i know what you mean
i was not thinking of that
well, i own it.
i will answer you.
but, sir, are you sure he is as guilty as they say?
and who is this wretch?
who can tell?—a vagabond, a corsican.
has no one owned him?
no one; his parents are unknown.
but who was the man who brought him from lucca?
another rascal like himself, perhaps his accomplice.
villefort
for heaven’s sake, madame
but
but this is trampling on the weak, sir.
the weakness of a murderer!
his dishonor reflects upon us.
is not death in my house?
oh, sir
be it so!
no, madame
sir
arrested!
he was taken at compiègne, and all is over.
adieu, sir
adieu, madame
it is not he
now you may drink.
the count of monte cristo!
do not call anyone—do not be alarmed
listen to me
maximilian!
maximilian!—has he then owned all to you?
you have promised him that i shall live?
yes.
but, sir, you spoke of vigilance and protection. are you a doctor?
yes; the best you could have at the present time, believe me.
but you say you have watched?
i was hidden behind that door
valentine
poison—death!
what are you saying, sir?
hush, my child
i did say poison and death. but drink some of this;
oh, yes
this is how you have lived during the last four nights, valentine
sir
yes.
you saw the person?
yes
oh, heaven
oh, yes, yes!
then that explains all
but who, then, is this assassin, this murderer?
then you do not know who it is that attempts your life?
no
who could desire my death?
you shall know it now, then
how do you mean?
oh, heavens
valentine
i think i hear a noise
leave me.
good-bye, for the present
valentine!
valentine
well
do you still doubt?
oh
have you seen?
alas!
did you recognize?
oh, yes;
i saw, but i cannot believe!
would you rather die, then, and cause maximilian’s death?
oh
it is already done
but
why am i thus pursued?
no, i have never injured her.
edward? poor child! are all these crimes committed on his account?
ah, then you at length understand?
heaven grant that this may not be visited upon him!
valentine, you are an angel!
but why is my grandfather allowed to live?
ah, then, indeed, sir
command me, sir—what am i to do?
you must blindly take what i give you.
alas, were it only for my own sake, i should prefer to die!
you must not confide in anyone—not even in your father.
my father is not engaged in this fearful plot, is he, sir?
sir
i will watch over them as i have over you.
well, sir, do as you will with me;
oh, heavens, what will befall me?
alas, alas, what a fearful extremity!
valentine, would you rather denounce your stepmother?
i would rather die a hundred times—oh, yes, die!
i will think of maximilian!
yes
go
whatever happens, i promise you not to fear.
graces
good
help, help!
what is the matter?
what is it?
yes, yes; let us hasten up; it was in valentine’s room.
call madame de villefort!—wake madame de villefort!
what?—this one, too?
oh, where will be the end?
what are you saying, doctor?
i say that valentine is dead!
ah
ah
go to the assistance of madame de villefort
madame de villefort is ill.
but mademoiselle de villefort——
mademoiselle de villefort no longer requires help
since she is dead.
dead,—dead!
dead!
who said valentine was dead?
how are you, sir?
well
you are thoughtful, sir
yes
oh
yes, yes
yes, yes, yes!
quicker, quicker!
dead,—dead!
who are you, sir
go!—do you hear?
he is mad!
see what they have done!
sir
tell them
sir
you are mistaken, sir
what do you mean, sir?
gentlemen
yes
now, sir
yes
assuredly
sir
and i say that murders _are_ committed here
oh, you rave, sir
i rave?
yes, yes
and i, too
oh, merciful heavens!
stay
m. noirtier wishes to speak.
yes
do you know the assassin?
yes
and will you direct us?
do you wish me to leave?
yes
alas, alas, sir, have pity on me!
may i, at least, return?
yes.
must i leave alone?
no.
whom am i to take with me? the procureur?
no.
the doctor?
yes.
you wish to remain alone with m. de villefort?
yes.
but can he understand you?
yes.
oh
you can come
gentlemen
i entreat you——
but
the culprit—the murderer—the assassin.
do not alarm yourself, sir; justice will be done
yes
oh, sir
will this promise be fulfilled, m. noirtier?
yes
swear, then
yes
the doctor of the dead.
alas
she is indeed dead, poor child!
yes
and now the priest.
is there any particular priest you wish to pray with valentine?
no.
fetch the nearest.
the nearest
d’avrigny
do you wish to see him?
this is the abbé of whom i spoke
sir
ah
then i need not tell you what kind of service he requires of you.
i was about to offer myself, sir
it is a young girl.
thank you, sir
see
yes, you are right
grief has stunned him
see, i have not slept
do you require my services now?
no
shall you be present in the reception-room?
poor girl
indeed, no
did you know her?
who is he?
whom do you mean?
the gentleman who receives us? is he a deputy?
oh, no. i am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day
but he is perfectly unknown to me.
have you mentioned this death in your paper?
still
i am seeking the count of monte cristo
i met him on the boulevard, on my way here
his banker? danglars is his banker, is he not?
i believe so
morrel? do they know him?
still, he ought to have been here
well
besides what?
alas, do you not know?
what new calamity?
my daughter——
mademoiselle danglars?
eugénie has left us!
good heavens, what are you telling me?
do you think so?
indeed i do.
and so mademoiselle danglars——
and is she gone?
the other night she left.
with madame danglars?
still, baron
yes
pray do so.
are they spanish, haitian, or neapolitan bonds?
no
baron danglars.’
one, two, three, four, five
this is how i transact business
it is really wonderful
you do not doubt it?
no!
no
what
oh, well, then
certainly
your receipt is money.
pardon me, count, pardon me.
then i may keep this money?
yes
yes, keep it—keep it.
no
certainly, i excuse you
but
oh, a mere nothing
count
are you speaking seriously?
i never joke with bankers
m. de boville, receiver-general of the charities.
_ma foi_
good-morning, creditor
you are right, baron
and yet they say orphans are to be pitied
poor things!
here i am in their name
yes.
i have brought my receipt.
yes; well?
well, m. de monte cristo has just carried off their five millions.
how so?
come
five millions!
here is his receipt. believe your own eyes.
it is really true
do you know the house of thomson & french?
it is one of the best houses in europe
i must visit him
and obtain some pious grant from him.
what example?
they gave all their fortune to the hospitals.
what fortune?
their own—m. de morcerf’s, who is deceased.
for what reason?
because they would not spend money so guiltily acquired.
and what are they to live upon?
the mother retires into the country, and the son enters the army.
well, i must confess, these are scruples.
i registered their deed of gift yesterday.
and how much did they possess?
certainly
yes; for the examination of our cash takes place tomorrow.
at two o’clock.
send at twelve
now i think of it, you can do better
how do you mean?
what, though payable at rome?
certainly; it will only cost you a discount of 5,000 or 6,000 francs.
_ma foi!_
i thought, perhaps
indeed
thank you, no, sir.
then it will be tomorrow.
yes; but without fail.
i will come myself.
better still, since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you.
by the way
no
bah, you are wrong. how were you to blame in that affair?
everybody pities you, sir; and, above all, mademoiselle danglars!
poor eugénie!
no.
oh, it is terrible!
fool!
yes, come at twelve o’clock; i shall then be far away.
to madame la baronne danglars.
i will place it on her table myself tonight
where is morrel?
we have already asked that question
see
how pale he is!
he is cold
not at all
bah
no, i do not
the discourse is over; farewell, gentlemen
oh, valentine!
i was looking for you, my friend.
you see i was praying.
shall i drive you back to paris?
no, thank you.
do you wish anything?
leave me to pray.
ah, count
maximilian has just returned, has he not, madame?
yes, i think i saw him pass; but pray, call emmanuel.
go, then
what shall i do!
i beg a thousand pardons
_ma foi_
are you hurt, sir?
i believe not. but what are you about there? you were writing.
i?
your fingers are stained with ink.
ah, true, i was writing. i do sometimes, soldier though i am.
you were writing?
i have already had the honor of telling you i was
your pistols are beside your desk
i am on the point of starting on a journey
my friend
sir?
i make a hasty resolution?
maximilian
indeed, count
i tell you that you are about to destroy yourself
and here is proof of what i say;
you wish to destroy yourself
you have written it.
well
yes, morrel
yes, i would do so.
you?
morrel——
and i again repeat, you shall not commit suicide.
prevent me, then!
i will prevent you.
who am i?
why do you mention my father?
julie, julie—emmanuel, emmanuel!
edmond dantès
listen, my friends
watch over him.
why so?
i cannot explain myself; but watch over him.
leave them
here is the relic
my child
oh
you have guessed rightly, madame
i shall have left this country
my kind friends, leave me alone with maximilian.
come
yes; for i begin to suffer again.
maximilian, maximilian
oh, do not fear, my friend
then we are to have no more pistols—no more despair?
poor fellow, what is it?
my grief will kill me of itself.
my friend
ah
look at me
oh, heavens
child!
i have told you to hope
my friend, my father
hope, my friend
ah
on the contrary
and you still bid me hope?
i tell you to hope, because i have a method of curing you.
what can i say more?
count, you prolong my agony.
then
or?
or, take care, morrel, lest i call you ungrateful.
have pity on me, count!
will you promise me?
but you are sure you will promise me this?
i not only promise, but swear it!
oh, i also swear it!
and now
haydée?
what has become of her?
she departed last night.
to leave you?
oh, lucien—oh, my friend!
well, what is the matter, my dear?
tell me what is the matter.
oh, lucien, can i confide in you?
lucien, a great event has happened!
m. danglars left last night!
left?—m. danglars left? where has he gone?
i do not know.
what do you mean? has he gone intending not to return?
then what did you mean——
stay—he left a letter for me.
a letter?
yes; read it.
‘madame and most faithful wife.’
read
‘baron danglars.’
well?
well, madame?
with what ideas does that letter inspire you?
certainly; but is this all you have to say to me?
i do not understand you
he is gone! gone, never to return!
oh, madame, do not think that!
well?
do you not answer me?
i have but one question to ask you,—what do you intend to do?
i was going to ask you
ah, then, you wish to ask advice of me?
yes; i do wish to ask your advice
then if you wish to take my advice
to travel!
deserted?
but then you are rich,—very rich, indeed
madame
but
excuse me, madame
now, madame
now, madame
thank you, sir—thank you
bah
i have 1,060,000 francs remaining
moonlight on a statue
mother, we have no more money.
mother
capital—nothing!
child!
alas, dear mother
i think so
with 200 francs?—are you sure, albert?
let us put down 120
but you, my poor child?
with a post-chaise and valet de chambre?
any way, mother.
well, be it so. but these 200 francs?
but we owe something in this house?
what is this?
a thousand francs.
but whence have you obtained them?
listen to me, mother, and do not yield too much to agitation.
you cannot imagine, mother, how beautiful i think you!
dear child!
ah, just so
have we come to any?
then these 1,000 francs——
are the half of the sum, mother; the other will be paid in a year.
the price of his blood!
yes, if i am killed
merciful heavens!
well, now you understand, mother!
do you think so?
yes, you will live!
i shall live!—then you will not leave me, albert?
mother, i must go
you will obey your own wish and the will of heaven!
it is well
but let us not yield to gloomy apprehensions
yes, let us strive, for you ought to live, and to be happy, albert.
and so our division is made, mother
we can now part; come, i shall engage your passage.
and you, my dear boy?
well, be it so—let us part
debray!
you, morcerf?
morcerf!
pardon me
i leave you, albert.
mother
how once?
what do you mean?
believe me, dear albert
thank you, sir
alas

he’s a fine looking fellow
he looks like a big-bug
come, sir
come
i tell you that with that wretched sum
of course—of course
well, then, lend him the twenty francs
surely you will not refuse a comrade!
i am no comrade of these people
let us horsewhip the fine gentleman!
benedetto!
i am called
to the visitors’ room!
everything
ah
good morning, benedetto
you—you?
do you not recognize me, unhappy child?
silence,—be silent!
you wish to speak with me alone, do you not?
oh, yes.
that is well.
read?
what is that?
oh
now
what have you to tell me?
and you?
you speak first.
come, come, you are going on quickly, m. benedetto!
no one.
how did you know i was in prison?
who, then, am i?
what do you wish me to say?
well?
well, in the champs-élysées there resides a very rich gentleman.
at whose house you robbed and murdered, did you not?
i believe i did.
the count of monte cristo?
do not let us jest
bah
why not?
oh, these are fine words.
and there will be fine doings, if you do not take care.
menaces—i do not fear them. i will say——
do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself?
my father—i will know who my father is
i came to tell you.
ah
and so closes our interview
i will return tomorrow
it shall be done
that’s what i mean
can i be deceived?
the salad basket.
never mind, we shall see! tomorrow, then!
tomorrow!
it is well, sir
today
yes
yes, be satisfied.
what are you bringing me?
a cup of chocolate.
i did not ask for it. who has paid me this attention?
madame de villefort wishes to remind you, sir
well
what then?
where to?
to the palais.
what to do?
my mistress wishes much to be present at the trial.
ah
does she wish that?
tell your mistress
yes, sir.
then come to dress and shave me.
directly, sir.
i am going to her.
ah, here you are, monsieur
edward
edward
do you hear me?—go!
go
go, my child.
dear me!
what is the matter?
madame, where do you keep the poison you generally use?
monsieur
i—i do not understand you.
i asked you
ah, sir
it is not for you to interrogate, but to answer.
is it to the judge or to the husband?
to the judge—to the judge, madame!
ah, sir
ah, sir
you do not answer, madame!
and you cannot deny it!
oh, sir
i beseech you, do not believe appearances.
are you, then, a coward?
sir! sir!
can you be a coward?
i understand
the punishment?
oh, do not fear the scaffold, madame
no, i do not understand; what do you mean?
no, no—oh, no!
you will thank me—for what?
for what you have just said.
no, no
no, you cannot wish that!
oh, mercy, mercy, monsieur!
oh, pardon me, sir; let me live!
she is cowardly
reflect that i am your wife!
you are a poisoner.
in the name of heaven!
no!
in the name of the love you once bore me!
no, no!
in the name of our child! ah, for the sake of our child, let me live!
i?—i kill my boy?
i kill my son? ha, ha, ha!
think of it, madame
do you understand me?
farewell, madame, farewell!
well
we shall see our friend!
yes, indeed!
a nobility of the rope!
he will be condemned, will he not?
yes.
what did he say?
something which will surprise you.
bah
he played the prince very well.
then you never believed in the principality?
yes.—in the principality, but not in the prince.
not so bad
ah, yes
there is something in what you have just said
but
strange? what do you mean, beauchamp?
my dear sir
stay
surely i am not deceived.
what is it?
it is she!
whom do you mean?
they said she had left.
mademoiselle eugénie?
has she returned?
no, but her mother.
madame danglars? nonsense! impossible!
come
i?
yes; you were telling us about the extraordinary death of valentine.
poor, dear woman
and i hate her
why?
or, rather, by instinct.
perhaps so. but to return to what you were saying, beauchamp.
‘multitudinously’ is good
my good fellow, you’ll find the word in saint-simon.
talking of that
who is madame?
the minister’s wife, _pardieu!_
i will not speak again
and who is the assassin;
young edward!
you are jesting.
we are listening.
why, what nonsense are you telling us?
yes, it is an extraordinary story
is it not?
it is absurd
ah
and this elixir, where is it? what is it?
the child conceals it.
but where did he find it?
in his mother’s laboratory.
does his mother then, keep poisons in her laboratory?
it is incredible!
come, beauchamp
he is worn out
by the way, m. de château-renaud
how is morrel?
why not?
because he is an actor in the drama.
has he assassinated anyone, then?
ah, very good.
hush, gentlemen, here is the court; let us go back to our places.
hem!
the court, gentlemen!
gendarmes
lead in the accused.
accused
your name and surname?
excuse me, mr. president
your age?
will you answer that question?
your age?
where were you born?
at auteuil, near paris.
your profession?
first i was a forger
are you looking for anything, mr. procureur?
and now, prisoner, will you consent to tell your name?
well
your name?
repeat your father’s name
my father is king’s attorney
king’s attorney?
gentlemen
i owe you the proofs and explanations of what i have said.
but
but how have you become acquainted with all these details?
proceed
but your mother?
the proofs, the proofs!
the proofs?
do you want proofs?
yes.
well, then, look at m. de villefort, and then ask me for proofs.
father
no, no, it is useless
no, it is useless!
how useless?
what do you mean?
what, m. de villefort
i am in possession of all my senses, sir
well
let them now say that drama is unnatural!
_ma foi!_
and moreover, it kills
and to think that i had an idea of marrying his daughter
she did well to die, poor girl!
the sitting is adjourned, gentlemen
well, what do you think of this, my fine fellow?
there will be extenuating circumstances
god
god—god!
oh!
ah
faster, faster!
yes, yes
come
nothing is changed here.
no one must disturb us
not locked
that is well.
not here
doubtless she is in her bedroom.
héloïse!
héloïse!
who is there?
open the door!
open; it is i.
héloïse, héloïse!
what is the matter? speak!
it is done, monsieur
what more do you want?
my son!
where is my son?—edward, edward!
edward, edward!
where is my son?
master edward is not downstairs, sir
then he must be playing in the garden; go and see.
in madame de villefort’s room?
edward!
edward!
still the hand of god.
you here, sir!
i came to pray over the body of your daughter.
and now why are you here?
good heavens!
no!
it is the face of the count of monte cristo!
you are not exactly right, m. procureur; you must go farther back.
that voice, that voice!—where did i first hear it?
yes; you are now on the right path
search—search!
but what have i done to you?
what have i done to you? tell me, then! speak!
who are you, then? who are you?
ah, i recognize you—i recognize you!
you are——
i am edmond dantès!
you are edmond dantès
then come here!
there, edmond dantès!
see, are you well avenged?
god is for and with me.
my child
where is m. de villefort?
it is not here!
it is not here!
sir, you have indeed lost a son; but——
oh, i _will_ find it
oh
he is mad!
oh, enough of this,—enough of this
prepare yourself, maximilian
have you nothing more to do there?
no
indeed
what a dire misfortune!
what dreadful sufferings!
if the supreme being has directed the fatal blow
do you not form a very rash judgment, emmanuel?
maximilian
to seek me?
yes
i am ready
whither are you going, count?
in the first instance to marseilles, madame.
to marseilles!
yes, and i take your brother with me.
oh, count.
you perceive, then, that he is not happy?
yes
i will undertake to divert him
i am ready to accompany you, sir
how farewell?
needless delays but increase the grief of parting
i have a passport, and my clothes are ready packed
good
and you leave us
but does maximilian go to rome?
i am going wherever it may please the count to take me
i am under his orders for the next month.
oh, heavens, how strangely he expresses himself, count!
maximilian goes with _me_
once more farewell, my dear sister; emmanuel, adieu!
his carelessness and indifference touch me to the heart
pshaw!
we must leave you
before you quit us, count
madame
never see you again?
say not so
restore my brother to peace and happiness
you still confide, then, in sinbad the sailor?
oh, yes
well, then, sleep in peace, and put your trust in the lord.
well
have you been to see the old man?
and have you placed the letter before him, as i ordered you to do?
and what did he say, or rather do?
yes.
good; he accepts
now let us go.
great city
morrel
no, count; but to leave paris——
maximilian
my friend
that may possibly be true
here
i was there;
oh, heavens!
yes
i recognized him.
how so?—you were looking the other way.
dear maximilian
i have to weep over the grave of my father
well, then, go,—wait for me there, and i will soon join you.
you leave me, then?
yes; i also have a pious visit to pay.
madame
i am, indeed, most wretched
he possesses a noble heart, madame
oh
alas
oh, look at me
no
it often happens
no, mercédès
enough
before i leave you, mercédès, have you no request to make?
thank you, edmond.
but have you no request to make for yourself, mercédès?
your son shall be happy, mercédès
but what are your intentions?
mercédès
ah, madame
alas!
will you not even say you will see me again?
on the contrary, we shall meet again
edmond, edmond, edmond!
i cannot have deceived myself
and yet they were the same
sir, we are at the landing.
would you like to hear the story, sir?
yes; relate it
this dungeon
ah, indeed?—mad!
and what was his mania?
he offered millions to anyone who would set him at liberty.
could the prisoners see each other?
and which of them made this passage?
blind fools!
ah, yes; i see
tell me.
no
then you pity him?
_ma foi_, yes; though he was in his own element.
what do you mean?
great is truth
was his name ever known?
oh, yes; but only as no. 34.
oh, villefort, villefort
do you wish to see anything more, sir?
yes, especially if you will show me the poor abbé’s room.
ah! no. 27.
yes; no. 27.
come, sir.
wait
this is fortunate
i have forgotten the other key.
go and fetch it.
i will leave you the torch, sir.
no, take it away; i can see in the dark.
he spent fourteen years to arrive at that
yes
‘_oh, god!_’
‘_preserve my memory!_’
oh, yes
follow me, sir;
from the appearance of the stone
sir
you have made a mistake; you have given me gold.
i know it.
sir
then, sir, since you are so liberal, i ought to offer you something.
no, sir, neither of those; something connected with this story.
really? what is it?
listen
ah
yes
yes.
i raised the stones, and found——
a rope-ladder and some tools?
how do you know that?
yes, sir, a rope-ladder and tools.
and have you them yet?
what is it?
a sort of book, written upon strips of cloth.
i will run for it, sir;
oh, second father
here, sir
ah
here is my answer. thanks, father, thanks.
here
take this pocket-book.
do you give it to me?
yes; but only on condition that you will not open it till i am gone;
to marseilles!
woe
maximilian
the dead are everywhere
maximilian
ah, count, i shall forget it.
oh, count, have pity upon me. i am so unhappy.
i have known a man much more unfortunate than you, morrel.
impossible!
alas
ah
one quits a dungeon in a week, a month, or a year.
he remained there fourteen years, morrel
fourteen years!
fourteen years!
well?
my father, too, is dead
oh!
but then he had the woman he loved still remaining?
you are deceived, morrel, that woman——
she was dead?
and has he found consolation?
he has at least found peace.
and does he ever expect to be happy?
he hopes so, maximilian.
you have my promise
only remember——
but, count, do you remember that the 5th of october——
child
do you leave me?
when do you leave?
i am entirely yours, count.
goddam
_allegro!_
_moderato!_
good! i have it still!
messrs. thomson & french?
whom shall i announce?
baron danglars.
follow me
ah, ha
here you are, peppino!
yes
there is no great merit due to me, for we were informed of it.
you know his business here, then.
_pardieu_, he has come to draw, but i don’t know how much!
you will know presently, my friend.
you must have searched badly.
luigi vampa himself searched.
in that case he must either have paid his debts——
a russian do that?
or spent the money?
possibly, after all.
well?
joy, joy—the sum is large!
five or six millions, is it not?
yes, you know the amount.
on the receipt of the count of monte cristo?
why, how came you to be so well acquainted with all this?
i told you we were informed beforehand.
then why do you apply to me?
that i may be sure i have the right man.
yes, it is indeed he. five millions—a pretty sum, eh, peppino?
hush—here is our man!
will your excellency visit saint peter’s?
i did not come to rome to see
i came to touch!
then your excellency is going——
to the hotel.
casa pastrini!
your excellency.
your highness.
which road?
the ancona road
_non capisco_
very well.
i will stop at the first posting-house
_non capisco_.
eh?
eh, _mio caro?_
come, my friend
where are we going?
_dentro la testa!_
put in your head!
some gendarme!
where are you taking me?
_dentro la testa_
decidedly
oh, unfortunate!
they must have obtained my arrest.
_mon dieu!_
they are robbers, perhaps
_scendi!_
_di quà_
_avanti!_
who comes there?
a friend, a friend!
but where is the captain?
there
fine spoil, captain, fine spoil!
is this the man?
himself, captain—himself.
very well, show him to me.
the man is tired
conduct him to his bed.
oh
oh, god be praised
it is a real bed!
_ecco!_
yes, yes
no
singular bandits!
faugh!
ah, ha
may i be hanged
monsieur deniseau, let me have a nice little fricassee today.
_che cosa?_
come, come
come
_on y va_
put in your head!
excuse me, sir, but are they not going to give me any dinner?
does your excellency happen to be hungry?
and your excellency wants something to eat?
at once, if possible
nothing easier
of course!
that is not the custom, excellency
a bad reason
but i am content. let me have some dinner!
at once! what would your excellency like?
give your orders.
have you kitchens here?
kitchens?—of course—complete ones.
and cooks?
excellent!
well, a fowl, fish, game,—it signifies little, so that i eat.
as your excellency pleases. you mentioned a fowl, i think?
yes, a fowl.
a fowl for his excellency!
i could almost believe myself at the café de paris
here, your excellency
here, excellency
pardon me, excellency
ah, ha
stay a moment, your excellency
i said they would skin me
come, how much do i owe you for this fowl?
your excellency has given me a louis on account.
a louis on account for a fowl?
certainly; and your excellency now owes me 4,999 louis.
very droll
very droll indeed
come, now
is it not a joke?
we never joke
what! a hundred thousand francs for a fowl!
then that will make only 4,998 louis more
i shall get them all in time.
oh, as for that
brute!
then open the door directly.
are you hungry?
come, you understand me.
what would your excellency like to eat?
bread? very well. holloa, there, some bread!
how much?
four thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight louis
what? one hundred thousand francs for a loaf?
one hundred thousand francs
but you only asked 100,000 francs for a fowl!
and what am i to pay with, brute?
come
certainly
but how can i pay them?
here
here is a draft at sight.
and here is your fowl.
here i am, your excellency
what do you want?
something to drink.
your excellency knows that wine is beyond all price near rome.
then give me water
come
it is the same old story.
come, my friend
you will not refuse me a glass of wine?
i have already told you that we do not sell at retail.
well, then, let me have a bottle of the least expensive.
they are all the same price.
and what is that?
twenty-five thousand francs a bottle.
tell me
it is possible such may be the master’s intention.
the master?—who is he?
the person to whom you were conducted yesterday.
where is he?
here.
let me see him.
certainly.
you sent for me?
are you, sir, the chief of the people who brought me here?
yes, your excellency. what then?
how much do you require for my ransom?
merely the 5,000,000 you have about you.
but this is all i have left in the world
we are forbidden to shed your blood.
and by whom are you forbidden?
by him we obey.
you do, then, obey someone?
yes, a chief.
i thought you said you were the chief?
so i am of these men; but there is another over me.
and did your superior order you to treat me in this way?
yes.
but my purse will be exhausted.
probably.
come
will you take a million?
no.
take all, then—take all, i tell you, and kill me!
but when i have no more money left to pay you?
then you must suffer hunger.
suffer hunger?
most likely
but you say you do not wish to kill me?
no.
and yet you will let me perish with hunger?
ah, that is a different thing.
well, then, wretches
as your excellency pleases
thou shalt die!
are you not a christian?
here i am
what do you want?
take my last gold
and let me live here; i ask no more for liberty—i only ask to live!
then you suffer a great deal?
oh, yes, yes, cruelly!
still, there have been men who suffered more than you.
i do not think so.
yes; those who have died of hunger.
yes
do you repent?
of what must i repent?
of the evil you have done
oh, yes; oh, yes, i do indeed repent.
then i forgive you
the count of monte cristo!
you are mistaken—i am not the count of monte cristo.
then who are you?
rise
is that monte cristo?
yes, your excellency
we have reached it.
we have reached it!
yes; that is the haven.
your excellency
what signal?
ah, yes
give it to me.
give way
ah, your excellency
good-evening, maximilian; you are punctual, thank you!
ah, is it you, count?
oh, yes
you are looking for the sailors.
yes, i paid them nothing, and yet they are gone.
never mind that, maximilian
count
how so?
here you laugh.
you are right to recall me to myself, maximilian
oh, no, no, count
you are wrong, morrel; i was really happy.
then you forget me, so much the better.
how so?
then you are not consoled?
oh
listen
count
my friend
no, indeed,—i am calm
my friend
be it so
come.
as you please
let us talk like men
go on!
count
there is something true in what you say
yes
and if you wished to die, you would choose this death, count?
yes.
now i understand
yes, you have guessed rightly, morrel
do you then regret nothing?
no
not even me?
what
oh, i entreat you
i am endeavoring
count
i swear to you my soul is no longer my own.
what do you mean?
count, i have your word
it is half-past eleven.
morrel, can you intend it in my house, under my very eyes?
then let me go
it is well
this is what you asked for
i thank you from the depths of my heart
stay!
friend
i feel that i am dying; thanks!
is it heaven that opens before me?
valentine, valentine!
he is calling you
oh, thank me again!
oh, yes, yes, i thank you with all my heart
you then love haydée?
oh, yes, with all my soul.
well, then, listen, valentine
of me? oh, am i happy enough for that?
henceforth she will be alone in the world.
alone in the world!
and why?
then you leave me, my lord?
it is well
oh, heavens
oh, heavens
i am young
you mean, then, that if i leave you, haydée——
i should die; yes, my lord.
do you then love me?
oh, yes
what do you mean, my lord?
do you hear him, valentine?
have i discovered the truth?
oh
dearest
ah, it is jacopo
the captain of the yacht;
do you wish to speak to us?
i have a letter to give you from the count.
from the count!
yes; read it.
edmond dantès, _count of monte cristo_.
but
what do you mean?
look!
gone
gone!—adieu, my friend—adieu, my father!
gone
adieu, my sweet haydée—adieu, my sister!
who can say whether we shall ever see them again?
darling
‘_wait and hope_ (fac et spera)!’
